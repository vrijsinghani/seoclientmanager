well this is bound to be interesting Jason calanis on screen now an early investor in Uber who I still believe owns a very healthy steak in the company and the other Allin besties discussed Tesla's robot taxi event and then of course the SpaceX catch plus a very interesting disclosure pretty surprising one to be honest for one of the four guys all right our boy Elon had a big week Tesla inil two new Concepts at its we robot event and Elon Elon caught a 23 story rocket the Starship here's the robo taxi and the robo both of them look really awesome and he caught one of the I think this is the fifth Starship or the fourth launch fifth the fifth right incred look at this unbelievable it's like Chopsticks catching whatever issues are with Elon and his politics just to appreciate and we can talk about why this is so important in this segment but technically the achievement of this like Skyscraper falling out of the sky and perfectly aligning itself to go into that Chopstick catching device it is an absolute Marvel of human Ingenuity I mean just and it was the first [ __ ] attempt absolutely incredible and the work and the effort that people put into this over you know several decades it's just such an incredible feet look at this thing I don't know if you guys were as emotionally moved by this as I was I thought it was incredible it was incredible I think I probably watched this a hundred times totally from every angle every angle and so the reason this is so important is because these things cost a lot of money and when they land here you can clean them up and I guess his goal is to have them take off again after he fills them with propellant an hour later freeberg so on a science basis this is extraordinary what uh you know if this works and you start lifting specific you don't want it to have feet a it's heavy and then B you have to lift them up in a way that just complicates the entire refueling and cycle time process so by catching it you put it right back into place and just go again unbelievable unbel you just catch it and go again I can kind of walk through these numbers so obviously the big objective over time is how cheap can you get it to put material into space we need a lot of material to go into space if we're going to do things in space particularly if we're going to go build a colony on Mars and so this shows you over time the cost per kilogram which is the key metric in this industry to launch material into low earth orbit and you can see here how SpaceX has dramatically reduced the cost I remember when the small sat era began in the 2010s do you guys remember all these startups that were starting to build like little small SATs and put them up to do imaging and coms and stuff when this took off it was about 10,000 bucks a kilogram to put a small set into space or to put material into space and then SpaceX has dropped the cost to the point that it's now close to $1,000 a kilogram so a 10x reduction and cost in just the last decade or so and that's why SpaceX just dominates the the launch market but Elon always said that $1,000 a kilog is too high that his objective has been to get the cost down to 10 bucks a kilogram because at 10 bucks a kilogram you could launch what some people estimate is needed to get to Mars which is about half a million tons of material and people to set up a colony on Mars and it actually becomes feasible to get you know half a million tons of material at 10 bucks a kilogram so if you look at this new starship and Starship heavy booster it's about 150 200 tons payload the booster holds you know 3,400 tons of propellant and uh the cost of that propellant is pretty low you know it's uh it's only about a million dollars in fuel so then if you can get the cost of the booster and the Starship down enough and you can reuse it enough and you amortize the cost of making that device over the the lifetime of of the device the cost per launch comes down and that's what brings the cost per kilogram down so the booster there's a group called payload and they do estimates on this so I won't speak out of term in terms of like having inside knowledge but the payload has estimated that Starship and the booster cost about 90 million bucks today and they think that they have a path to getting it down to 35 million so if you can reuse that thing 10 times that's a $3.5 million cost per launch plus a million for fuel you could easily see and this thing can launch 200 tons that's how you start to get to 10 bucks a kilogram over the next couple of years but it was critical to be able to reuse that heavy booster and that's what Elon just demonstrated is we can actually catch that heavy booster refuel it and launch it an hour later and if you can do that over and over again you're spending 10 bucks a kilog to put material into space you can get fuel into space and then get those Starships to fly off to Mars and deliver all this material including setting up a base that would allow you to actually make more fuel on Mars because everything we need to make fuel is on Mars so it's the beginning of the next series of really important Milestones that'll hopefully get Humanity onto Mars it was just so amazing to see it come together the economics are I mean this is like a THX reduction and cost it's incredible yeah it's going to be musk himself put this in context very nicely the other day the cost reduction that Starship will ultimately usher in it's the difference between refueling your car to drive a mile versus buying a car to drive a mile and throwing it away an unfathomable cost reduction this is how disruption Works amazing and they're going to do some I guess new stuff with Starling some even lower Earth orbit satellites that go even faster and have less latency so that's going to be super exciting starlinks apparently I mean I know everyone here is a sh shareholder in SpaceX but starlinks running at 4 million Subs right now that's like a hundred bucks a month four million subs and if you do the math I mean how many people have isps that are slower than starlink right how many people have cell phone providers that they're paying roughly the same amount that aren't as good as starlink if we can get satellite to phone and you can get starlink more broadly available this could be 100 million subscriber business I mean this could be abely buses on the on the on the earth it could be the largest subscription business in the history of humanity I think the largest ones right now are like Netflix you know 250 Disney plus 150 Verizon 100 million so yeah it's could be hundreds of millions of subscribers it could even be could be the first 500 million subscriber product in the world we could look back one day and be like why did we run all this copper wire everywhere you like we don't need it yeah obviously crazy especially if it can get crazy that we were like ever I mean the whole nutty thing about this past week it's like we could look back one day and be like why did we ever drive cars and why do we ever have copper wire laid all over the Earth to like move internet signals around he actually does have a point we will look back eventually and go what the [ __ ] can you seriously believe was that convoluted and expensive obviously we've had to take sort of baby steps along the way you don't just invent the first telephone and then suddenly have starlink but the difference with extremely low launch cost and a global swarm of satellites able to provide high-speed internet blanking the entire surface of the planet and I don't just mean the highly populated areas literally the entire surface even the top of Mount Everest with highspeed reliable internet the capital cost of that at scale when launch costs will continue to come down even lower versus having to literally dig holes in the ground lay down expensive copper wire have hard connections into homes it's unbelievably inefficient the way things are done today and onto the topic of autonomy and personally owned Vehicles again we will look back eventually and people are going to think why the did people really spend tens of thousands of dollars to own a vehicle they hardly ever used have to pay insurance and maintenance never mind the fact that people crashed and injured themselves died were disabled permanently injured Etc over a million deaths a year on average in vehicle accidents most preventable and they also had to allocate valuable real estate to actually park the car in their home in a garage and a driveway what it is going to take time but that is where we're headed so to freedberg point means absolutely nailed it bro just a incredible just incredible chth any thoughts on the robo van or the Cyber cab the model two I guess some people are calling it but it's you know the Cyber cab specifically not calling it number two and doesn't have a steering wheel or pedals I would have bought two of those immediately if it had steering wheel and ped I want to drive it yeah looks like the hybrid of like a model Y and the Cyber Tru so I kind of really love the Aesthetics of it so beautiful yeah you like it my my my reaction was actually I don't know just seeing these releases now over 10 or 15 years plus of knowing him nothing it's it's I guess it's like not that surprising maybe it's it's weird to say like I just expect him and his teams to figure it out like they're just all so good it's and the thing to remember it's not just him that's incredible but he attracts a kind of Technical and operational Wonder kind people for sure and that's just that's just a really special thing so I had had that reaction which was I was really proud and happy for them for the team yeah for sure for the team and for him these guys are like incredibly Fearless fail bigly right yeah if you're GNA fail fail bigly yeah and then the other thing that I thought was crazy was how many people were trying to dunk on him this weekend and well this is true but I mean it's an obvious explanation people who hate themselves just projecting it outward almost all this Hate by the way coming from men and almost all of these men believe they have some potential in fact probably more potential than they'd like to admit yet none of it has been realized they hate themselves they hate their lives they hate their circumstances and rather than looking inward maybe doing some internal work taking some risks getting out there it's just much easier for them as a coping mechanism to just hate on Neilon I saw a hilarious super cut of some doofus on the internet I don't know who he was but they'd cut this guy reacting to in real time to the Starship launch and the catch and it was the most embarrassing thing I've ever seen in my life the poor guy just couldn't say a single positive thing clearly he's got Elon derangement syndrome big time and obviously it's one of those cases of just projecting your very low selfworth out onto someone else instead of doing something about it it's easy just to cope he's a fraud he's a liar they suck he's not a real engineer everyone that does the work for him his employees are really the ones doing everything he's not even that smart he's just lucky all this kind of [ __ ] really sad to see but it's completely explicable these people just hate themselves and they're just projecting that out onto Elon how can you I mean how can you dislike the guy he's courageous he's adventurous he takes risks he employs over 100,000 people globally has a massive track record of success he'll speak his mind he isn't owned by anyone he isn't beholden to anyone he's putting his personal safety at risk and suffering endlessly chewing glass staring to the abyss over and over and over and over why cuz he's just trying to be as useful as possible in his time here on Earth I mean how can you dislike the guy but the answer is if you hate yourself that's a possibility surpris H me off guard because I think that they were personalizing a lot of anxiety that they are feeling through these company successes which didn't make much sense to me well In fairness he did hurt some people's feelings with posting of memes so yeah I mean it's it makes no sense like the guy is like going to save 30,000 Road debts a year in the United States with self-driving and people are losing their minds over a couple of memes or who he's voting for for president I don't think you have to worry about that you can just look at the products they speak for themselves anything um saaks any response on the uh on the Tesla front any thoughts on the the bus or Optimus I mean they're both very exciting products I don't think I've got a lot to add yeah I love the bus freeberg I think that thing could become like mobile homes R you know adus and you could just send them to can you can we buy them or no well no not spoiler alert there are going to be a bunch of variations on this product including an RV version although I think the commercial pseudo bus is going to be first but KN my [ __ ] words you will be able to buy this eventually as an RV # vanlife not right now but I I think that might be you know that that's kids in one I need it for all my kids yeah well see if this was a platform like the Mercedes Sprinter vans have become that you see a lot in Europe then oh my God that is exactly what is going to happen you could buy an empty one of these it's got enough battery life to last a month and then let's say you had your in-laws over and was one that was set up as like a one-bedroom you could click on Airbnb or you know Tesla BNB press a button and the thing could drive to your driveway you could rent it for a week and then it could leave or let's say a thousand people or 10,000 people were displaced because of a hurricane freeberg you could send a 100,000 of these to the parking lots at Walmart which typically does a good job in in feeding people and getting them supplies after hurricanes since those are so U you could put a 100 of these in every parking lot and have a place for people who are fleeing uh natural disasters to stay so I thought that was like the most compelling product of the whole thing for me was the possibility of a sled like a skiff that you could do anything you want with would be really exciting for society so congratulations to the team and it's it's going to take a while but I I I could see them having that Robo I think congrats to amid he just got promoted I saw that yeah he's in charge of all AI I think he's in charge of all manufacturing and sales in North America oh okay well there it is shout out to am abire yeah I mean listen guys I have I have big news I just bought my first Tesla oh you did did you go with plaid Model Model S plaid yeah yeah I test drove now I I call me crazy I just kind of assumed all these guys would be driving Teslas when they're pretty smart and they can afford it this is interesting mean for all the record Jason kenis put down I believe the very first ever reservation for a Tesla Model S now that is some faith in your friend a Model S not a model 3 S anyway please tell us more Mr freed Burgers to why you finally decided to take the plunge and buy it as the model S did did you go with a plaid Model S model S plaid yeah yeah I test drove it for two weeks and sold itself and are you using the FSD I use FSD every day I used FSD and it was like really impressive so super impressive I I've tried Tesla a couple times over the years and I never really never really worked for me the quality just didn't feel like what I like given what I had before the carwise ah there it is he needs the Unicorn tears in the wiper fluid and the woolly mammoth pubes for the seat stitching that was putting in my fire stand now you were an Audi guy right but Audi guy yeah always guys yeah that's that's like it's uh was a big milestone I really I thought the FSD was the selling and then the speed on the Plaid is is just insane it's better than my RS7 like I um with all of my Teslas I put it in show mode because when it's in that plaid mode or whatever like coffee go but if you have passengers the kids in the back seat will get like literally nauseous because it's too fast you got to be you got to be careful with the passengers there it's so fast it was awesome so is it just me or was there a severe lack of discussion about tesa's autonomy event I mean they talked a little bit about the van it's almost like Jason's didn't want to talk about the potential robotaxi implications that was it these guys of course invest in Opportunities and autonomy is a decar trillion as in 10 plus trillion dollar opportunity and all we really got was all the band was cool and sacks basically I have nothing useful to add wow unless you're new here and have also been living under a rock for the last nearly four years you'll know that the Democrat machine has been going after Elon Musk and his companies for nearly the last four years relentlessly trying to slow the guy down stifle him attack his character diminish him paint him in a negative light and the hate stream media propaganda machine has been adding fuel to the fire his recent going all in on Donald Trump is going to take this to another level the all in besties have some thoughts including the latest example of ridiculous lawfare and politically motivated [ __ ] being thrown the direction of Elon Musk if Trump loses what's the next four years on this part going to be like what are we do here we lose he's moving to New Zealand there's going to be laware all over the place absolutely they're going to come for you do you really think so David yeah I do I mean look I'm definitely not the top of the list elon's at the top of the list right so he has he has no choice but to go all in they're already doing laware against him ridiculous but I think the point is just that if they're not defeated did they're going to keep doing it because there's no downside for it I will comment on the California Coastal commission ruling that was based on elon's political tweets which is why they stopped additional launches out of vandenbberg first of all how the California Coastal commission has authority over vandenbberg and the operations it just seems to me like there's something wrong the coastal commission was set up with the coastal act in 1976 in California as a way to give the beaches back to the people and the public and create a commission to regulate building along the beaches it has since grown into effectively a much larger uh entity with much more Authority which potentially after the Chevron ruling in the Supreme Court may get peeled back and may get dialed down we'll see what happens but as of now they have the ability to block launches out of vandenbberg which they did and in their decision they said it was because of elon's political tweets again starting at the beginning of the show about the success that they had with the Starship this week it's incredible it deserves to be recognized on merits of what they accomplished but to bring in his political tweets to make a decision about the progress of SpaceX and allow public space to be used to further that that cause and further that activity seems to me abhorent and it's ridiculous and it also has to be illegal I mean Hello free speech by the way the funniest thing I just have to say this how [ __ ] stupid are the morons who admitted they've made this decision based on Elon Musk expressing his thoughts and opinions I mean if you're going to do something illegal and ideological and politically motivated and again keyword here illegal surely you're not dumb enough to admit what and why you've done it but here's the problem if you happen to live in a thought bubble in say for example com fornia and everyone that you know knows that one orange man bad and two Elon bad you're so [ __ ] stupid you don't realize don't even consider what you're doing might be illegal because everyone around you it's a gigantic Circle Jer bad orange man bad yeah constantly I just can't believe it you have to understand guys how stupid and ated you need to be to think it's okay to do something like this and to be dumb enough to say it out loud guarantee by the way musk has filed a lawsuit he will win and they'll be held to pay it's exactly what's wrong with the bureaucratic moras that a lot of these institutions have grown into and this was you think they're gonna be Pro or con smrs exactly yeah wait did he just did he just say SMR grown into and this was think they're gonna be Pro or con smrs exactly yeah no I'm I can confirm I guarantee absolutely no question comorians are 100% anti- smm serious do you think beiss what the coastal commission does is they they they block they block everything and they do pictures of the entire Coastline if you build like a shed on your beachfront property they will know it and they come to you and they're like no sheds you cannot build any structures on the beach they're just like really really hard it's a values decision that the state of California made in 1976 the state of California the the citizens voted and said we want to preserve the coastline and I think that that's a reasonable value for them to assume and and vote for and it was a majority vote and so they established the coastal commission but how the the coastal commission extended into having authority over Vandenberg and launches from there for SpaceX to me is part of this kind of administrative you know growth like we see all these administrative bureaucracies get started that have a very simple objective preserve the California coastline but now they have authority to determine whether or not launches can happen ace at the coal commission referenced his tweets and her name was Of course Karen McCaren the vote was 64 to increase these so who is this she did it in an official context I think she was like retweeting it there was like a tweet from her yeah this is what I'm don't understand she credit for it I mean in a way she do a favor she's proud of it she said the quiet part out loud so in a way she does a favor which just she acknowledged that all of this lawfare against SpaceX and Elon is political she basically pleaded guilty to it look she's proud of it because she doesn't think there's anything wrong with it she thinks this is her job is as a bureaucrat she's supposed to punish people who tweet things that you're not supposed to say that basically is what it comes down to and um I mean this is the truth about lawfare they're using the agencies of the federal government to exact rep reprisals against their political opponents and if there's not if there's not a punishment for that it's going to keep going and they they've filed a uh elon's filed a lawsuit and it's a six4 decision so I I think the way the Biden Harris Administration could stop that they could say no more law fair but they don't do that because the tone was set from the top and Trump is saying he's going to be a dictator and he's going to do a bunch of law fair when he gets in there so okay that is the most I was going to say a word don't get canceled that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard Jason say I can all right you know what David sax is going to debunk this I don't even need to go here but this [ __ ] dunce must actually watch the fake news God damn it anyway sax will say it more eloquently than I can here it's coming got to settle it down that's exactly what he said this has been another qu okay J you can't a show like that that's just not cool I'm just trying to wrap up so we can move on yeah see this is the old drop and run tactic here Jason just said some total [ __ ] and then trying to move on this is completely false by the way Trump is on the record repeatedly being asked in podcasts and long form interviews will you seek retribution in the same way that the Biden Administration and others have been coming after you he specifically said no the whole point is to move past that he could but he won't this is not something I'm making up I've watched a bunch of his content okay I've seen what the guy has said with his own mouth repeatedly he's more focused on American Prosperity than seeking Revenge upon political opponents and as for the supposed dictator comments I can't [ __ ] believe how dumb Jason is the context of these comments was Trump specifically saying I do not intend on being a dictator however on day one yes I'm going to close the border immediately and drill baby drill that was the context okay in other words I will immediately do whatever it takes to stop the flood of illegal unvetted immigrants into the United States which is a [ __ ] National Emergency and massively Drive the prices of energy down once that's done I won't be a dictator that's literally the quote this is what he talked about I can't believe Jason is this dumb actually I can I mean he's got severe TDS but the fact that he'd say that on a podcast to a massive audience and not understand the context of these comments is just astonishing bro then don't make a SL comment at like just do something else talk about something else besides Trump at the end like just giving my opinion I'm not allowed to give my opinion on the show op what are you grateful for right now in your life I'm grateful for you doing all the work on the events and making them spectacular I'm really excited for saaks live from marago oh God I will totally go to Mar Lago for election night can we get a booth there that would be hilarious it it's not clear you would be invited yeah exactly of course I'm invited Trump loves mebody neither neither you nor I gave the hundreds of thousands of dollars per ticket to go to dinner with Trump please that Trump loves me he he enjoyed very selective it's for friends getas get an invite okay I'll do it remote that's fine you can do it remote that's fine you don't want Jake out there it's fine go go with me wait when is the El I don't want to be I don't want to be at a party I
