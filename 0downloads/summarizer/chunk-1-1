all right buckle up because we are diving deep into some big AI news it's huge open AI just launched a bunch of updates to their API which for anyone who's not a techie and you know those are the brains behind all those apps that seem to be reading our minds these days right like the API is the magic that lets developers take open AI superpowers and weave them into their apps and these updates game changers really no seriously we're talking apps that not only get your words but your pictures too and can respond instantly no more waiting around for some robot to catch up it'll be like having like an AI sidekick right there in your pocket totally but okay before we geek out too much let's break this down for everyone listening right starting with I think the most mind-blowing model distillation ooh yeah that's a good one so imagine right you got this massive powerful AI program like the motherload of all AIS exactly but it's been like concentrated is tilled into something that can run smoothly on your phone so you're getting the same quality AI but it's smaller faster more efficient okay so for developers that's huge massive what about for you know the everyday person scrolling on their phone what difference will they actually see think realtime translation apps that just work even if you're offline or voice assistant that can actually keep up with a fast conversation so nor I'm sorry it didn't quite catch that exactly okay that's seriously impressive but let's be real building and running these AI models that's stuff gets pricey bro absolutely especially for like newer developers and that's where open ai's next move is so interesting because they just rolled out this thing called prompt caching wish can we just take a second to appreciate how much this is going to change the game okay so quick reminder for everyone listening when we talk about prompts we mean those super Specific Instructions you give to an AI like write a sonnet about a cat wearing a tiny hat and those prompts they cost money each time a developer uses one and it can really add up big time but with prompt caching open aai is basically saying we got you now the API will remember commonly used prompts so developers can reuse them without getting slammed with extra fees it's brilliant making AI more affordable more accessible who doesn't love that I mean it's like getting your favorite latte at a discount exactly and this could be huge because the more affordable it is the more developers even those just starting out can jump in and start experimenting with AI and building the next generation of amazing ads speaking of which yeah are you ready for this next update because I don't think anyone's ready for this okay get this remember how we talked about apps understanding images right like actually seeing them hold on to your hats because now you can actually train GPT for with pictures wait hold up you're telling me we can show pictures to an AI not just show train it it can learn from them my mind is officially blown mine too every time so what does this actually look like in the real world give me some examples okay imagine AI that can analyze medical images and help doctors make faster diagnoses wow or picture this you need a new website for your business but you don't know the first thing about coding been there now imagine just showing a few examples of websites you like to an AI and it just like makes it for you that's the idea it's like having a personal web designer powered by AI okay I am officially living in the future right and the best part is knowing open AI they're not going to keep these tools a secret they're offering free training tokens so developers can start experimenting with vision fine-tuning right away they're basically saying here's the future go play exactly because they know that the real magic happens when Brilliant Minds get their hands on new tools who knows what incredible things people will create this is huge I can't wait to see what developers come up with me neither but before we get lost in a sea of possibilities which is easy to do believe me there's one more gamechanging update we've got to talk about real time okay yes and this one this is about how we actually experience AI this is about to change everything this is about to change like everything about how we experience AI okay I'm intrigued lay it on me remember like those robotic voices Oh you mean that sound like a computer trying way too hard to sound human yes exactly well say goodbye to those days because open ai's real-time API it's going to make conversations with AI feel as natur as talking to you know another person you're saying no more Awkward pauses or that robotic monotone gone it's like the technology finally caught up with you know with what we've been imagining like AI that can actually keep up with us in real time right and this is huge I mean think about accessibility too oh absolutely this could be revolutionary for folks who have trouble like typing or using traditional interfaces right it's like AI for everyone this is truly Next Level stuff oh and it gets even better the real- time API it's not just about Voice open AI is already hinting at multimodal experiences wait like video calls with AI That's the idea they're thinking big okay my brain is officially fried mine too and we're just getting started but for now let's bring it back down to earth for a sec good idea we've covered so much ground it's easy to get lost in the tech Wheats it really is so to recap for everyone listening we've talked about model discol which is making AI smaller and faster more efficient right and then there's prompt caching making AI more affordable and accessible which is key absolutely and of course the totally mind-blowing Vision fine-tuning which is just Next Level AI that can understand images come on straight out of sci-fi I know right and then top it all off with this whole new world of real-time interaction it's almost too much to process it's a lot what stands out to you as the biggest change honestly all of these updates are huge in their own right but I think the Common Thread here the thing has got me really pumped is accessibility you know Y open AI is making all of these powerful tools available to a much wider range of developers which ultimately means more creative and Innovative AI popping up in our everyday lives exactly and don't forget those advancements in realtime interaction and multimodal understanding we're finally breaking down those barriers between humans and machines it's going to change everything about how we live and work think about it no more clunky inter faces or robotic interactions just like this seamless flow between you and your Tech and we're already starting to see glimpses of this like have you seen what coframe is doing with vision fine tuning oh yeah they're using it to like supercharge their AI powered growth engineering assistant right they're training it on images of websites in their code so the AI can basically design websites on its own it's like having a web designer in the cloud and that's just one example think about like health care oh man the possibilities in healthcare are Limitless AI that can analyze medical images in real time helping doctors make faster more accurate diagnosis especially in those really critical situations where every second counts exactly and for folks with disabilities imagine AI powered by Vision fine-tuning that could help them navigate the world it's like we're giving AI the ability to see to understand the world the way we do but with even greater precision and speed and that has the potential to change change everything we're not just talking about making things faster or more efficient we're talking about solving real world problems improving people's lives in ways we haven't even thought of yet and that's what makes this whole AI Revolution so exciting it's not just about the tech itself but about what we do with it you know it's about using these incredible tools to build a better future for everyone it's like we're holding this like this key to A Whole New World and it's our job to figure out how to use it to explore it responsibly exactly because you know every exploration comes with like its own set of challenges right like we're bound to hit a few bumps in the road absolutely and that's okay it's all part of the learning process you know figuring things out as we go so where do we go from here what does the future hold for AI I mean after seeing all these advancements it's kind of hard to even imagine what's next I know right it's moving so fast but if these open AI updates tell us anything it's that we're on the cusp of something huge okay so give me your prediction what's the next big thing in AI I think we're going to see a massive shift in how we interact with the technology like it's not just going to be about screens and keyboards anymore more intuitive more like integrated into our lives exactly AI is going to become more like a natural extension of ourselves you know it's like AI is finally catching up to like our imaginations and maybe even surpassing them which is honestly a little bit mindblowing I'm here for it me too 100% And you know what's really cool as all of this develops we're going to see developers and entrepreneurs creating things we can't even dream of right now that's the beauty of it right the possibilities are endless exactly it's exciting and a little bit overwhelming to be honest I can imagine so what advice would you give to like the average person who's maybe feeling a little intimidated by all this new tech don't be afraid to you know just dive in and play around experiment there are already tons of amazing AI powered apps out there just you know get a feel for it get curious yes curiosity is key don't be afraid to ask questions and you know just see what AI can do because ultimately it's all about using these tools to you know enhance our lives and make things better exactly AI might seem super complex but at its core it's really just about using technology to solve problems and make things easier for us and who knows maybe one of our listeners will be the one to come up with the next big AI breakthrough I love that thought all right so if we had to sum up everything we've talked about today in one sentence one sentence that's tough what would it be hm okay how about this the future of AI is here it's bursting with potential and it's up to us to shape it responsibly I love it on that note that wraps up this deep dive into open Ai and all the mind-blowing updates they just dropped on us it's a lot to process it really is we covered everything from smaller faster AI models to AI that can like understand images in ways we never thought possible and let's not forget that realtime interaction Game Changer one thing's for sure AI is changing the world as we speak and it's only going to get Wilder from here so buckle up because the future is coming in hot and it's going to be amazing
