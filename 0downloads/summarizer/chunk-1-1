Create a new app in the project called "Crawl Website" in apps/crawl_website.

The app will look loosely like the page template at templates/pages/applications/kanban.html, specifically three cards styled the way the three cards are styled.

The first card is titled "Site to crawl", inputs: 

1. Url to crawl (URL), placeholder: https://example.com, 
2. Maximum depth of crawl (Int) placeholder:0.

Below the input boxes is a button "Initiate Crawl"

After a URL is entered, a function call is immediately made to a browserless instance specified by environment variables : BROWSERLESS_BASE_URL and BROWSERLESS_API_KEY using the following as an example usage guide:  
curl -X POST \
https://production-sfo.browserless.io/screenshot?token=MY_API_TOKEN \
-H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
"url": "https://example.com/",
"options": {
"fullPage": true,
"type": "png"
}
}'

After the request returns, the image is then stored in the users file_manager directory in a subfolder called crawled_screenshots with a unique id for future reference and the image is placed below the "Initiate Crawl" button.

---

When the initiate crawl button is pressed, the app will kick off a function to crawl the URL asynchronously using celery taks based on the code in /apps/common/tools/crawl_website_tool.py

Once the celery task is kicked off, when the getlinks_to \_visit has a list, chart link the "visitors" chart in templates/pages/dashboards/crm.html will show a graph where the label "Visitors" = "Total Pages", the number 5,927 is the total links to visit, the number +55% represents the links visited / total links to visit (i.e. percent complete), the Y axis is the percent complete (0-100) and the x-axis is minutes and dynamically changes every 5 seconds to update.

  
Furthermore, a list of all links to visit is displayed in another subcard below the Total Pages card. it uses the component called "Orders overview" in templates/pages/widgets.html where the icon is one of two  icons (one icon to show it's complete and the other that it is not.)  The main label is the path (minus the host/sever) of the link to be visited.  
  
Do not modify /apps/common/tools/crawl_website_tool.py but create an async version of it for use by celery.
