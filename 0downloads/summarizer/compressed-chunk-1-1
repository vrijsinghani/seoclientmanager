Here are the detailed bullet point notes:

- Apology for unplanned arrival on Earth, specifically in Silver Lake, Indiana
- Caused by distraction from 200 rambunctious hatchlings in the ship
- Zolak and the narrator disagree on who was responsible for the wrong directions
- Assure that the military response was justified, as their species would have reacted the same way
- Apologize for deploying Organic Liquidator Orbitals as a countermeasure
    - Zolak insisted on installing them due to a bad experience with an aunt
    - Effective but an overreaction
- Apologize to specific groups affected:
    - Civil War Re-enactment Community, Chapter 239
        - Replica weapons mistaken for authentic, vaporized 43 human "war zealots"
        - Left two vats of bio-paste to offset food loss
    - Silver Lake Fire Department, Women's Auxiliary, Girl Scout Troop #782, Rotary Club, Starlight Junior Girls Dance Team, Chippewa County Antique Car Club, Fall Harvest Parade attendees
        - Damage from ship's atmospheric retro-thrusters
        - Many lives lost, labor cost to rebuild
    - Anyone impregnated by their "precious" spawn
        - Discomfort from implantation process, side effects
        - Short gestation period for "needle-toothed stomach exploder" larvae
        - Do not feel guilty about slaughtering offspring
    - Apology for the lake itself
        - Radioactive runoff from Organic Liquid Orbitals
        - Water unpalatable for 3000 years, no organic life likely to return
        - Green glow is a permanent feature
