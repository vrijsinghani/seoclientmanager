III. Key Learnings from Building AI Agents
    A. Data is King:
        1. AI agents are only as good as the data they are trained on.
        2. Data needs to be up-to-date and relevant to the business context.
        3. The process of onboarding an AI agent is similar to onboarding a human employee.
    B. Data Collection and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):
        1. Data collection is crucial for keeping the database up-to-date.
        2. RAG allows the agent to retrieve information from the vector database.
        3. Automations are essential for data collection.
    C. Automated Prompt Engineering:
        1. Prompt engineering is crucial for agent performance.
        2. Structured prompts are necessary for agents to function effectively.
        3. Poorly written prompts can lead to inconsistent or unreliable results.
        4. Prompt Template:
            a. Objective: Clear overall objective for the agent.
            b. Context: Details about the agent's role and environment.
            c. Instructions: Detailed instructions on how to perform the task.
            d. Output Requirements: Desired output format.
            e. Examples: Plentiful examples are essential for training the agent.
    D. Tools:
        1. Tools give AI agents agency.
        2. n8n allows building custom workflows that can be used as tools.
        3. Example: Email actions workflow that allows the agent to perform various email tasks.
        4. The speaker demonstrates how an agent can use tools to send an email and schedule a meeting.
        5. The agent's understanding of natural language can be challenging, requiring some learning curve.

IV. Conclusion
