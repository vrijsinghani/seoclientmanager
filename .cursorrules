How to Customize
When a template file is loaded in the controller, Django scans all template directories starting from the ones defined by the user, and returns the first match or an error in case the template is not found. The theme used to style this starter provides the following files:

# This exists in ENV: LIB/admin_soft_pro
< UI_LIBRARY_ROOT >                      
   |
   |-- templates/                     # Root Templates Folder 
   |    |          
   |    |-- accounts/       
   |    |    |-- signin/basic.html    # Sign IN Page
   |    |    |-- signup/basic.html    # Sign UP Page
   |    |
   |    |-- includes/       
   |    |    |-- footer.html          # Footer component
   |    |    |-- sidebar.html         # Sidebar component
   |    |    |-- navigation.html      # Navigation Bar
   |    |    |-- scripts.html         # Scripts Component
   |    |
   |    |-- layouts/       
   |    |    |-- base.html            # Masterpage
   |    |    |-- base-fullscreen.html # Masterpage for Auth Pages
   |    |
   |    |-- pages/       
   |         |-- widgets.html         # Widgets page
   |         |-- messages.html        # Messaging APP Page
   |         |-- *.html               # All other pages
   |    
   |-- ************************************************************************

When the project requires customization, we need to copy the original file that needs an update (from the virtual environment) and place it in the template folder using the same path.

For instance, if we want to customize the footer.html these are the steps:

Step 1: create the templates DIRECTORY inside your app
Step 2: configure the project to use this new template directory
Edit settings.py TEMPLATES section
Step 3: copy the footer.html from the original location (inside your ENV) and save it to the YOUR_APP/templates DIR
Source PATH: <YOUR_ENV>/LIB/admin_soft_pro/includes/footer.html
Destination PATH: YOUR_APP/templates/includes/footer.html
Edit the footer (Destination PATH)
At this point, the default version of the footer.html shipped in the library is ignored by Django.

In a similar way, all other files and components can be customized easily.
