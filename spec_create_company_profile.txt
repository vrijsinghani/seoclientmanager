Create a new tool fashioned like apps/agent/tools/crawl_website_tool/crawl_website_tool.py that takes a URL as input and returns a Company Profile based on the text of the website at URL.
Once a website is crawled by calling apps/agent/tools/crawl_website_tool/crawl_website_tool.py, the returned text is converted to a count of tokens.
If the count of tokens is greater than settings.SUMMARIZER_MAX_TOKENS the text is sent to a compression tool apps/agent/tools/compress_text_tool/compress_text_tool.py.
write a tool that takes a large chunk of text as input and compresses it according to an algorithm similar to /apps/common/tools/compression_manager.py. Suggest any improvements in the algorithm to make it efficient.  Follow the pattern of apps/agents/tools/search_context_tool/search_context_tool.py.  store the tool in apps/agents/tools/compression_tool/compression_tool.py. The default model used is settings.SUMMARIZER.
