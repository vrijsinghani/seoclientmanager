Students learn best when they are challenged and supported. That’s why our academic environment is rigorous, guided, and flexible. With your team of advisors, you’ll choose a program, as well as the number of experiential programs you’d like to complete. Select a college or program to learn more about this area of study. You can also search specific keywords to narrow down the list.
Considering a few options? Explore our combined majors! These interdisciplinary programs pair together two fields of study. Combined Majors offer you an incredible opportunity to explore multiple fields.
Any majors marked with an asterisk (*) indicates that they are offered at both the Boston and Oakland campuses.

A double major entails completing all requirements for both majors. Depending on the majors, there may be an overlap in requirements. Conversely, combined majors require at least nine courses associated with each of the two participating disciplines, rather than completing all requirements for each major. There must be at least one course that acts as a bridge between the disciplines.
Combined Majors
Passionate about philosophy but have a knack for computer science? Looking to improve your Spanish and develop a firm understanding of international affairs? At Northeastern, combined majors allow you to do both. Combined majors are unique, hybrid degree programs that encourage students to explore multiple academic fields, all while staying on track for graduation. Northeastern offers 180+ defined combined majors with curriculum specific to each individual academic program.
When applying to Northeastern through the Common or Coalition Application, you may apply directly into any of the combined majors. If you are interested in a major combination not listed below, upon enrolling at Northeastern, we encourage you to speak with your academic advisor to explore what opportunities may be available for you to study both subjects. Though the academic experience in a combined major may occur across two colleges, upon graduation, one degree will be conferred by one academic college. The college that will award the degree will be listed on your Application Status Check, and will not have any impact on your application for admission, as applicants to all majors and colleges are considered holistically.
199 combined majors are listed below in alphabetical order, along with the names of the associated colleges. For example: Computer Science and Behavioral Neuroscience (Khoury, COS) is a degree program consisting of courses housed in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences and the College of Science. If a program lists only one college, that combined major will include courses from two distinct degree programs within the same college. A list of college names and acronyms are provided below. To see all majors offered at Northeastern, check out our Areas of Study page.
