A geomagnetic storm is hitting the northern part of the U.S. Here’s how the solar event may impact you
Warnings about Hurricane Milton hitting Florida have dominated news reports this week. But there have been warnings from forecasters with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center about another storm brewing: a severe geomagnetic storm.
What is a geomagnetic storm?
According to Jonathan Blazek, an assistant professor of physics at Northeastern University, these events are triggered by a coronal mass ejection, which is when the sun lets off a mass ejection of particles. Sometimes, these particles hit Earth and interact with our magnetic field and upper layers of the atmosphere. This, Blazek says, is a geomagnetic storm.

What happens to sea life during hurricanes? Can they move to calmer waters? A marine scientist explains
When hurricanes roar in, expect sharks to head out to sea, corals to shatter, and grouper and other reef fish to end up dead on shorelines.
Hurricane Milton was making its way across the Gulf of Mexico Wednesday and expected to make landfall in the Tampa Bay area on the west coast of Florida.
A big storm like Milton can be expected to churn the water 60 to 80 feet below the sea’s surface, says Mark Patterson, a professor at Northeastern’s Marine Science Center.

Scientists recreate genome of 52,000-year-old freeze-dried woolly mammoth
The 52,000-year-old freeze-dried remains of a woolly mammoth were so remarkably preserved that scientists were recently able to reconstruct its genome. Their discovery not only unearths new information about these ancient creatures but reveals a new kind of natural preservation that could open the door to studying other intact ancient animals.
“This is fascinating because this is a new type of fossil,” says Michele Di Pierro, an assistant professor of physics at Northeastern University who was one of many researchers involved in the research that was published in Cell. “Typically, we see in fossils the displacement of organic material with minerals, and that preserves larger structures. Here, this is a molecular fossil. Here we’re talking about each piece of DNA … is in exactly the same position as it was 50,000 years ago.”

Is Tampa prepared for the devastating impact of Hurricane Milton?
As Hurricane Milton barrels toward central Florida, Northeastern University disaster recovery experts say residents should expect extensive destruction from the storm and its surge — particularly if Tampa is hit directly.
“Tampa is the most vulnerable place,” says Q. Jim Chen, professor of civil and environmental engineering and marine and environmental sciences at Northeastern.

Here, this is a molecular fossil. Here we’re talking about each piece of DNA … is in exactly the same position as it was 50,000 years ago.”

Is Tampa prepared for the devastating impact of Hurricane Milton?
As Hurricane Milton barrels toward central Florida, Northeastern University disaster recovery experts say residents should expect extensive destruction from the storm and its surge — particularly if Tampa is hit directly.
“Tampa is the most vulnerable place,” says Q. Jim Chen, professor of civil and environmental engineering and marine and environmental sciences at Northeastern.

A geomagnetic storm is hitting the northern part of the U.S. Here’s how the solar event may impact you
Warnings about Hurricane Milton hitting Florida have dominated news reports this week. But there have been warnings from forecasters with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center about another storm brewing: a severe geomagnetic storm.
What is a geomagnetic storm?
According to Jonathan Blazek, an assistant professor of physics at Northeastern University, these events are triggered by a coronal mass ejection, which is when the sun lets off a mass ejection of particles. Sometimes, these particles hit Earth and interact with our magnetic field and upper layers of the atmosphere. This, Blazek says, is a geomagnetic storm.

What happens to sea life during hurricanes? Can they move to calmer waters? A marine scientist explains
When hurricanes roar in, expect sharks to head out to sea, corals to shatter, and grouper and other reef fish to end up dead on shorelines.
Hurricane Milton was making its way across the Gulf of Mexico Wednesday and expected to make landfall in the Tampa Bay area on the west coast of Florida.
A big storm like Milton can be expected to churn the water 60 to 80 feet below the sea’s surface, says Mark Patterson, a professor at Northeastern’s Marine Science Center.

Scientists recreate genome of 52,000-year-old freeze-dried woolly mammoth
The 52,000-year-old freeze-dried remains of a woolly mammoth were so remarkably preserved that scientists were recently able to reconstruct its genome. Their discovery not only unearths new information about these ancient creatures but reveals a new kind of natural preservation that could open the door to studying other intact ancient animals.
“This is fascinating because this is a new type of fossil,” says Michele Di Pierro, an assistant professor of physics at Northeastern University who was one of many researchers involved in the research that was published in Cell. “Typically, we see in fossils the displacement of organic material with minerals, and that preserves larger structures.

PlusOne Degrees and Accelerated PhD Programs
The PlusOne program allows current Northeastern students the opportunity to pursue both a bachelor’s and master’s degree successively in a condensed period of time. We also offer Accelerated PhD programs in Biology and Physics.
Overview
For students pursuing a PlusOne degree, several credits of undergraduate work are replaced by graduate coursework, thus permitting the completion of an undergraduate degree, as well as a full master’s degree, in a shorter period of time than would be possible if students pursued each degree separately through the traditional route.
In most programs, with appropriate academic progress, students receive the master’s degree one year after completing the undergraduate degree.
To apply to the PlusOne Master’s degree or Accelerated PhD program you must be a current Northeastern undergraduate student. Interested students should see the requirements below for more information before applying. Students should apply to enter the PlusOne program no earlier than their fifth academic semester and at least two academic semesters before expecting to earn the Bachelor of Science degree (three academic semesters prior for Marine Biology). Eligible candidates will complete an online application. No GRE or application fee is required!
Note: Any financial aid a student may have received from the university while an undergraduate will not continue once the student obtains graduate status. PlusOne students are not eligible for the Double Husky Scholarship.

Accelerated PhD Programs
BS Physics
To participate in the program, students must be on spring co-op (Div BA) or skip their last co-op, and must have a 3.5 GPA in their physics courses for accelerated entry into the program. Students can participate by successfully completing the degree requirements, including successful completion of two 7000-level physics graduate courses and one shared 5000 level course before receiving their BS degree (PHYS7321, PHYS7301 and PHYS 5318). All students must email the Graduate Director by April 1 before the start of their final undergrad year for permission to take 7000 level courses to enter the first stage of the BS/PhD program. Acceptance into this stage will allow students to take the 7000 level courses required for entry to the program, but this does not guarantee admission to graduate portion of the program. Students would then apply formally to the graduate program by December 1 of year 4 (or year 5 for undergraduate students opting for a 5-year BS track), and receive their BS at the end of year 4 (or year 5 for undergraduate students opting for a 5-year BS track).
BS/PhD students will apply to the Physics PhD program by December 1 in the final year of their BS degree. If students meet the grade and course requirements, we will require only standard application materials such as a personal statement, two letters of recommendation, and transcript. These limited application requirements are defined as accelerated admission and contingent upon successful completion of the 2 – 7000 level courses and 1 – 5000 level course. Students must have a grade of B or higher in all three courses to apply for accelerated admission.
Students interested in pursuing the Accelerated PhD in Physics should first contact the Graduate Director, Paul Whitford to express interest and find out more about the program.
Interested students should review application requirements and submit their application. Undergraduate transcripts will be automatically uploaded by Graduate Student Services once the application is complete. No GRE or application fee is required!

Science, Our Endless Frontier
The big questions of today require more than the sum total of our knowledge and ingenuity—they demand data, and lots of it. By harnessing powerful tools and algorithms, researchers can decode scientific complexities faster and at greater scales than ever before. A new, data-driven frontier has emerged, empowering scientists to transform our understanding of the world.
And with 37 interdisciplinary research centers and institutes, 15 of which are housed in the College of Science, Northeastern stands at the edge of the frontier. Come be a part of the next era of discovery.
Sort By Research Area
Motor skills such as throwing a ball, eating with knife and fork or dancing are uniquely human and key to functional behavior. Optimizing the acquisition and preventing or reverting the degradation of skill requires a rigorous quantitative understanding. The Action Lab analyzes how human neurophysiology and task mechanics constrains sensorimotor skills and their change. This work has applications for and performance enhancement and recovery after neurological injury.
Dr. Melloni studies the neurobiology of aggressive behavior. The main goal of this research is to understand how drug use and exposure to social stress during adolescence alter brain development and influence aggressive behavior.
Dr. Ayers’ research focus is on the neuroethology of motor systems in invertebrates and lower vertebrates and the application of this knowledge to the development of advanced robots.
Dr. Sikes specializes in the neurophysiology of the cingulate cortex; in particular, the role of cingulate cortex in pain sensation. Research has included pathway investigation to understand pain information transmission, and now focuses on contrasting the effects of somatic and visceral noxious stimulation on cingulate neuron activity.
The primary focus of Dr. Jackson’s research is on how exposure to cocaine (and other psychostimulants including methamphetamine) during pregnancy affects neuronal interactions in the fetus throughout development. We utilize neurochemical and behavioral strategies to assess alterations in brain areas modulating motor function and reward throughout development.

Psychology Colloquium: Leveraging Brain-Based Predictive Models to Establish Neuroimaging Signatures of Behavior Across Populations
College of Science
A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is understanding how brain structure and function contribute to individual differences in complex behaviors across both healthy and clinical populations. Recent advances have introduced brain-based predictive models as a promising approach for revealing neuroimaging signatures of behavior at the individual level. However, it is increasingly evident that these models, and our understanding of brain-behavior relationships, can be biased across different populations.

Mathematics
Journey to the Start
The College of Science mathematics degree prepares students not only to solve for (x), but to see the whole equation.
Plane A leaves at 1:00 pm, averaging 450 mph. Plane B leaves at 6:00 pm, averaging 400 mph. Which plane gets there first?
You’ve heard a problem like this before, but never outside a classroom. Because in the real world, it’s much less black and white.
That’s because life has invisible variables. For instance, it will depend on the accuracy of weather pattern predictions to account for delays. It will depend on assessments about the plane’s material parts and fuel efficiency. It will depend on the air traffic controllers issuing course corrections in real time. All these factors will contribute to when the planes will arrive.
So what’s the answer? The truth is that the answer is too small for the real question. The world depends on more than just calculations — it requires people who have the foresight and perspective necessary to keep the planes arriving on time.

Download our Principles of Community here.
We stand against racial violence and systemic injustice against Black people. We stand for anti-racist policies, equity, and justice within our College and across Northeastern University. We denounce the insidious disrespect of women that furthers gender inequity in science. We will work towards the following strategies in support of these principles:
- Cultivate a Culture of Respect and Collaboration
- Build a College that is Representative of Society
- Foster a Connected Community
In June 2022, we submitted a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Action Plan to the Northeastern Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. We have identified specific milestones to support our objectives and strategies, and we will review them quarterly. We emphasize that this is a dynamic and evolutionary process, and we invite your input and participation. We cannot rely on those individuals most impacted to fix the problem.

Equity Programs to Promote Equity and Respect
Bob Case Academy: Bridge to Calculus (Mathematics)
This alliance between Northeastern University’s Mathematics Department and the Boston Public Schools (BPS) prepares students in rigorous mathematics, and therefore for college and professional success. The classical Bridge to Calculus program, launched by Northeastern’s Professor Emeritus Robert (Bob) Case in 1994, grew from 25 students to well over 100 students in recent years. Over the last 10 years, it has significantly increased the number of Black and Hispanic students taking the AP AB Calculus course and exam in the Boston Public Schools. The classes are taught on Northeastern’s Boston campus by experienced Boston high school teachers, with Northeastern faculty and undergraduate mentors offering collaboration and providing support. In addition, Bridge to Calculus has been an inspiration for the Math Department’s Calculus Field Day, a competition in April at Northeastern’s Boston campus involving teams from many Boston public schools. Typically, over 100 students from BPS participate in this event and in 2019, Mayor Walsh also attended. The Bridge to Calculus program has prepared students from marginalized groups for college acceptance and college success, and it has supported Northeastern’s efforts to recruit a diverse undergraduate population, including women, in STEM areas. Beginning this year, Bob Case Academy: Bridge to Calculus will build upon the traditional six-week summer enrichment program, including a year-round online Question Center (homework help for Calculus or Precalculus courses) for students, as well as individual tutoring by NU faculty, students, and community volunteers.
More on Bridge to CalculusBEACHES: Bridging Each Applicants Chances for Higher Education Success (Marine and Environmental Sciences)
Despite improvements in gender diversity in the geosciences in the last 40 years, ethnic and racial diversity has remained stagnant at the PhD level. Thus, efforts to increase diversity at the undergraduate level have not translated to the graduate level; additional programs are needed that specifically target the transition from undergraduate to graduate school. The BEACHES bridge workshop invites underrepresented minority and first-generation college students who are interested in graduate programs in marine and environmental science to spend three days at Northeastern, where we discuss career opportunities requiring graduate degrees in these fields, work with students to hone their graduate school applications, and prepare them for the application process. In the process, we pair participants with both faculty and peer mentors involved in the program. Because a single mentor is unlikely to meet all of a students’ needs, establishing these tiered mentoring networks is critical to continued student success. The goals of BEACHES are to increase the likelihood that students who participate in the program will apply to graduate school, and to enhance the probability that they will be accepted into a graduate program. We anticipate that a small portion of BEACHES students will apply to and attend Northeastern University for their graduate degrees, helping to increase representation in our graduate programs.
NU-SCI: Northeastern University Skills and Capacity for Inclusion (Biology, Chemistry and Chemical Biology)
Chemistry professor Mary Jo Ondrechen and Biology professor Wendy Smith are leading the Northeastern University Skills and Capacity for Inclusion (NU-SCI) project that focuses on training faculty on inclusive teaching and mentoring skills to include non-traditional students in the science majors and in the process of scientific discovery. Funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), NU-SCI aims to increase interest and success in the sciences for students who are underrepresented on the basis of their race/ethnicity as well as first-generation college students, using Northeastern’s renowned experiential learning approach as an educational foundation to the program. The project holds teaching circles to further faculty education, promotes course design and content to create a more inclusive environment, develops strategies for more effective instruction and mentoring of nontraditional students, and offers monthly gatherings for students in the Foundation Year Program that welcome, engage, and foster the success of nontraditional students. “First-generation students and Black, Indigenous, students of color are underrepresented in our science majors and we need to do a better job of including the whole talent pool,” said Ondrechen. “Improvements in curricula and in teaching and mentoring practices will create a better learning experience for all students.” Northeastern joins 23 other institutions across the country who were funded by the first round of HHMI’s 2017 Inclusive Excellence Initiative—a program aimed at helping increase capacity of colleges and universities to effectively engage all students so they can be successful in science, especially non-traditional students and undergraduates who enter four year institutions through nontraditional pathways.

Psychology
Food for Thought
The College of Science psychology program works to explore the deepest inner workings of our brains and uncover why we do what we do.
Whatever you do, don’t think about oranges.
Don’t think about their round shape, their bright, textured skin, and their aromatic sweet smell. Just don’t.
So you thought of an orange — and that’s ok. We know it’s hard not to precisely because that’s what our brain is built for: rapidly processing and translating stimuli from our five senses into information, thoughts, and impressions of the world around us. In microseconds, we weigh all of this against what we know, what we think we know, what we feel, and what we have experienced.
Given a certain set of variables, the study of psychology then becomes about understanding and predicting what factors might correspond to thoughts and behavior.
From understanding how a certain customer demographic will respond to commercials, to the ways in which children develop a code of ethics, to yes, even why you thought about oranges after you were told not to, we’re here to help you think about the “why” behind how your brain thinks.
Diversity & Inclusion
The Department of Psychology at Northeastern University is a community of scholars committed to cultivating a culture of inclusion, equity, respect and connectedness. We can develop a more equitable and inclusive psychological science when we encourage a diversity of thought, culture, and viewpoint, which are essential to lifelong learning. Diversity encompasses individuals from any group or identity that has traditionally been marginalized in the academy, in particular in science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) disciplines.
Action Plan:
- Increase the diversity of the department at all levels
- Ensure that every faculty search and graduate student recruitment process maximizes the diversity of the pool of candidates.
- Promote STEM across the entire undergraduate community, including psychology and non-psychology majors.
- Ensure that issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion remain central in all departmental activities.
- Examples: student awards, colloquia/career spotlights, service assignments, communications about diversity education and training events on campus, departmental newsletter.
- Support the inclusion of diverse sources of scholarship in syllabi and coursework, ensuring that a wide diversity of perspectives in psychological science are visible and discussed in all courses.

Linguistics
The Wonder of Words
How will studying linguistics enhance your future? You’re sitting in class, rapt at the presentation your professor is giving…when suddenly you’re jolted out of your reverie; you realize they said something you didn’t quite catch. What was that term they just used?
It makes you think about how you even got to this point. Your professor’s speech is, at its simplest, a continuous series of sounds, which your brain has automatically done the work of parsing into recognizable words. And not just that – you’ve also placed these words into a coherent structure, a series of sentences from which you’re able to glean even the most complicated of meanings. While all this is happening, you’ve also been attuned to the surrounding environment, so you can tell that your professor is serious about when the next assignment is due, but joking about how long your final exam will be.
How are you doing all of this, without actively thinking about it? And how do speakers of the thousands of different languages in the world go about their days doing exactly the same thing? How did any of you even learn to do this, if you were never actually taught to?
A College of Science education equips you with the tools to explore the answers to such profound questions – to better understand the striking complexity of linguistic knowledge, to appreciate the remarkable diversity of linguistic structure, and, along the way, to unravel a bit of the mystique surrounding this critical facet of the human experience.

Explores linguistics, the scientific study of language. Major topics include phonetics (production of speech sounds), phonology (sound systems in languages), morphology (structure of words), syntax (grammatical relationships between words and sentences), and semantics (meaning of words and sentences).
Explores the complex, often inexplicit relationship between language and culture, using a variety of methods drawn from the fields of anthropological linguistics and sociolinguistics. Questions may include: How do language and thought interact? How is language used to create and maintain social institutions and individual personae? How is language used differently by and across gender, ethnicity, and social class?
Surveys phonetics, the study of speech sounds, including articulatory, acoustic, and auditory phonetics. Articulatory phonetics topics include anatomy and physiology; cross-linguistic consonant and vowel articulation; aerodynamics of speech production; coarticulation phenomena; and phonetics of supersegmentals such as syllables, stress, tone, and pitch accent. Acoustic phonetics topics include the physics of sound waves, reading spectrograms, and performing acoustic analyses. Auditory phonetics topics include audition and speech perception.

There is no time like the present.
Through research, College of Science students develop a practical expertise and intellectual passion for their chosen field.
Stay Curious
Undergraduate researchers are better prepared for graduate school or professional employment because they have developed the skills and confidence to experiment. Student researchers discover that asking questions will lead to answers, and each answer leads to another question, another possibility, another opportunity. Undergraduate research allows students to dig deeply into the mysteries of their discipline and to discover themselves.

Biochemistry
Making sense out of life
The Northeastern biochemistry program explores how cell structure, chemical bonds and energy transformations impact our understanding of the mechanisms of life and provide a strong foundation for a host of impactful careers in the life sciences.
A person has many trillions of cells in their body and at any given time, there are thousands of biochemical reactions taking place within those cells, even when the body is asleep. There are so many important jobs to be done – you are truly never at rest!
Your heart rate speeds up after you hear a loud noise. Your eyes are able to see what’s around you. Your blood sugar level lets you know whether you should break down that fuel and use it now, or whether you should store it in your muscles for later. How do these signals have meaning inside of us? Biochemists study these reactions and many more.
Understanding biochemical processes is a crucial step in problem-solving some of the world’s greatest challenges – disease, hunger, pollution. The success of vaccines to mitigate illnesses like smallpox, influenza, and coronavirus are examples that show how important it is to have a deep understanding of how diseases work and how they can be targeted.
Diversity & Inclusion
The College of Science supports a culture where each person feels they belong, regardless of race, color, religion, religious creed, genetic information, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, national origin, ancestry, veteran or disability status. We celebrate the diversity of our community, and we seek to expand representation to further excellence. We commit to be a College where members act with respect, trust, collaboration, and communication, and where inappropriate behavior is reported and acted on without fear of retaliation.

Mathematics
Journey to the Start
The College of Science mathematics degree prepares students not only to solve for (x), but to see the whole equation.
Plane A leaves at 1:00 pm, averaging 450 mph. Plane B leaves at 6:00 pm, averaging 400 mph. Which plane gets there first?
You’ve heard a problem like this before, but never outside a classroom. Because in the real world, it’s much less black and white.
That’s because life has invisible variables. For instance, it will depend on the accuracy of weather pattern predictions to account for delays. It will depend on assessments about the plane’s material parts and fuel efficiency. It will depend on the air traffic controllers issuing course corrections in real time. All these factors will contribute to when the planes will arrive.
So what’s the answer? The truth is that the answer is too small for the real question. The world depends on more than just calculations — it requires people who have the foresight and perspective necessary to keep the planes arriving on time.

Science is the Olympics of discovery and application. The teachers who construct courses with elegance and insight, the researchers addressing questions with stunning logic, the students who learn things new and fascinating, and who understand new possibilities for their futures, are our Gold Medalists. Often, we play team sports, working together to the finish line of scientific solutions.
Everyone’s effort and contribution are medal-worthy when it comes to our College of Science at Northeastern University, across learning, teaching, research, and expert administration. Within a culture of respect and action toward equity, excellence in Science is what we do.
Like Olympic sports, Science research breaks frontiers, to reveal the unexpected and the fascinating, and toward powerful solutions. For example, biology researchers are understanding how bacteria become deadly pathogens, immune to current antibiotics, and devising new medicines to combat infection. Across marine and environmental sciences, investigators are examining how plastics cycle through the environment, and how to minimize their toxic impact. Mathematicians are combining their scholarship with computation to examine huge data sets, where some outcomes will improve accuracy of patient MRI scans. Physicists are working to derive exotic quantum materials that will revolutionize communications and detection. And our psychology researchers probe the brain as it thinks, leading to therapies for PTSD and autism. The Good Power of Science builds new cures, new energy sources, new materials, new ways to protect our planet, to address the greatest challenges of science and society.
In the Northeastern University College of Science, our research is intertwined with the great mission of educating students at every level, who become empowered for top careers or next educational steps. Our prowess in research and education is achieved by connecting across disciplines, across Northeastern University, across communities, and across our planet, so that we meet College of Science goals and supports the university’s academic plan.
Congratulations to every College member for participating in the Olympics of Science, thank you to each of you who support our work, and thank you for celebrating our excellence!

A geomagnetic storm is hitting the northern part of the U.S. Here’s how the solar event may impact you
Warnings about Hurricane Milton hitting Florida have dominated news reports this week. But there have been warnings from forecasters with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center about another storm brewing: a severe geomagnetic storm.
What is a geomagnetic storm?
According to Jonathan Blazek, an assistant professor of physics at Northeastern University, these events are triggered by a coronal mass ejection, which is when the sun lets off a mass ejection of particles. Sometimes, these particles hit Earth and interact with our magnetic field and upper layers of the atmosphere. This, Blazek says, is a geomagnetic storm.

What happens to sea life during hurricanes? Can they move to calmer waters? A marine scientist explains
When hurricanes roar in, expect sharks to head out to sea, corals to shatter, and grouper and other reef fish to end up dead on shorelines.
Hurricane Milton was making its way across the Gulf of Mexico Wednesday and expected to make landfall in the Tampa Bay area on the west coast of Florida.
A big storm like Milton can be expected to churn the water 60 to 80 feet below the sea’s surface, says Mark Patterson, a professor at Northeastern’s Marine Science Center.

Scientists recreate genome of 52,000-year-old freeze-dried woolly mammoth
The 52,000-year-old freeze-dried remains of a woolly mammoth were so remarkably preserved that scientists were recently able to reconstruct its genome. Their discovery not only unearths new information about these ancient creatures but reveals a new kind of natural preservation that could open the door to studying other intact ancient animals.
“This is fascinating because this is a new type of fossil,” says Michele Di Pierro, an assistant professor of physics at Northeastern University who was one of many researchers involved in the research that was published in Cell. “Typically, we see in fossils the displacement of organic material with minerals, and that preserves larger structures. Here, this is a molecular fossil. Here we’re talking about each piece of DNA … is in exactly the same position as it was 50,000 years ago.”

Is Tampa prepared for the devastating impact of Hurricane Milton?
As Hurricane Milton barrels toward central Florida, Northeastern University disaster recovery experts say residents should expect extensive destruction from the storm and its surge — particularly if Tampa is hit directly.
“Tampa is the most vulnerable place,” says Q. Jim Chen, professor of civil and environmental engineering and marine and environmental sciences at Northeastern.

The Master of Science in Marine Biology program delivers a unique combination of inquiry-based study, fieldwork, research, and workplace experience. This 15-month full-time program is offered in conjunction with Northeastern University’s Three Seas program where students spend a full academic year immersed in the study of marine biology in three distinctly different marine ecosystems (Gulf of Maine boreal intertidal and subtidal, Panama Atlantic coral reef and Pacific coral reef with coastal upwelling, and Pacific Northwest subarctic intertidal and subtidal). The progressive and incremental structure of our curriculum allows students with only an intermediate exposure to the biological sciences to emerge from the program ready to plan and execute marine research, whether in the top doctoral programs, or in a career with government agencies or private consulting firms. Of equal importance is that students finish the program knowing how to do science rather than simply how to understand it through the experiential capstone project that begins after the Three Seas coursework ends.
Graduates of this program are expected to achieve the following learning outcomes:

- They should be able to communicate the commonalities and differences in the three ecosystems they intensively studied to both scientific peers, and to a lay audience, from the perspective of ecosystem services, ecosystem function including the roles of biodiversity and trophodynamics, and future trajectories under global change including the roles of conservation biology, policy and economics to likely outcome scenarios. They should be able to marshal online resources in support of producing convincing arguments about global change to a lay audience by using data available from global ocean observing systems.
- They should produce a significant contribution to understanding of an aspect of marine biology from the capstone project that is shared with the world beyond the final presentation either via a lesson plan, scientific publication, grey literature report, video documentary, contribution to an online scientific database, or equivalent scientific output.
- They should be able to articulate how their interdisciplinary masters course of study has prepared them to contribute to the advancement of knowledge useful for understanding the oceans either through further study and research at the graduate level, or through identification of organizations where their training can be used to advance management of the oceans in a sustainable manner.

Dean Sive’s Letters to the COS Community
Gratitude – 12.15.2023
There is one thought in my mind this week.
On so many levels, I feel surrounded by gratitude.
There are the immediate ones – gratitude for being alive, for being able to feel the chill wake up of winter air, for being able to see the lovely pale winter sky. For being part of the mystical existence of life. Gratitude for my family, so beloved. Gratitude for dear friends, and gratitude for wonderful colleagues here, and around the world.Competence – 12.01.2023
I hope everyone had a peaceful, pleasant Thanksgiving break.
Reading – 12.08.2023
My mom encouraged us to read everything. Books will never hurt you, she said, and that remains largely true. Comics she was not keen on, so I read those at friends’ houses. I’m a huge fan of fiction, immersing you in human emotion, adventure, and underappreciated, a conduit to many fascinating facts. You never know what you’ll learn when you start exploring written material, and there’s always something interesting. I’m reading Mantel Pieces right now, brilliant book reviews that are insightful, funny and sad. I look through multiple newspapers every day – from the erudite analyses of the NY Times, Washington Post, and my favorite the Guardian, to Daily Mail with impressively snappy reporting. The Boston Globe is great. Our excellent Northeastern library has multiple subscriptions you can freely access.
Words – 11.17.2023
Tell me, what’s your favorite word? __________________________
For elegance, I might pick ‘evanescent’ meaning ephemeral, fleeting, momentary, or transient. According to Merriam Webster, while all these words mean ‘lasting or staying only a short time’, evanescent suggests a quick vanishing and an airy or fragile quality. To me, the word is mysterious and poignant, with a nice ring. But the term ‘favorite’ is quite vague and can mean varying things to each person.Some Good News – 11.3.2023
We need good news. For our mental well-being, we need a counterpoint to everything worrying. So, this week, let’s find some. We won’t forget about deeply troubling current situations or diminish their importance. But let’s take a different view right now.
Daylight Savings – 11.10.2023
One time, I was in London visiting my dear cousin Jane, and set my alarm to make an Amsterdam flight next day for a conference around Xenopus (frogs). On waking, I was puzzled to see that the times on my wristwatch and phone were different. Maybe the battery in my watch needed replacing? Jane was still asleep, but I thought the phone must be correct, and hurried to the airport. Later, I learned that the UK also has daylight saving time, and I happened to visit right over the change. Who knew?
The Meaning of Life – 10.27.2023
We worry about events in Maine, events in the Middle East, in Ukraine and elsewhere. I deeply hope that your loved ones are safe. Please remember that we are a Diverse College where Everyone Belongs.
The Helpfulness of Routine – 10.20.2023
Long ago, in a drafty house in Seattle, when the heating came on every morning, our lovely dog Rufus would come over to the vent next to the bed and position his nose into the blowing warm air. After half an hour or so, Rufus would shake off, and put his front legs and head on the bed, so that when I stirred, there were two beautiful, brown eyes looking right into mine. And it was time to get up, for our walk! I could count on Rufus, and the cadence set my morning routine for the years we were postdocs in that little house.
Focusing on what you can control – 10.13.2023
The first war between Israel and her neighbors that I remember was back in 1967. Though it was called the ‘six-day war’, implying closure, peace in the Middle East remains a dream unfulfilled. The present devastating violence in Israel and Gaza is horrifying in every way. My deepest prayers and warm wishes for the safety of your family and friends in the region. I hope they have food, shelter and medical care, and you are in contact.
Let's hear it for Plants! – 10.6.2023
I am 60% owner of a small succulent, initially entrusted to me when my daughter left for college. I have little talent in house plant care, but there was no one else. Five years on, it is still with me, now a proud co-owner, and even after I dropped it and broke the pot, the plant is doing quite well, with a multitude of little ones. This year, during Home Renovations, the plant has moved between Airbnbs, seeming content in its Starbucks tray.
Being Seen and Heard – 9.29.2023
This week, I was infuriated to see a 2022 video and report detailing how a young gymnast in a line of others being given participation medals, was totally ignored by the official handing out the medals. The gymnast passed over was Black, the others were not. When challenged, the official (of Gymnastics Ireland) said the mistake was ‘an honest error’ and ‘not intentional’. Wow. The family of the girl had to demand an apology, itself shocking. My stomach hurts thinking about this. How do you simply not see someone? How do you simply not see someone who happens to be Black? And how are you (and Gymnastics Ireland) not ashamed of your disrespect?
Easing into Fall – 9.22.2023
Moving gently out of summer, we’re at the culmination of the season’s new life. The small sparrows splashing in the rain outside Churchill, the young campus rabbits enjoying delicious grass, the leaves still fresh after our damp summer, and the late blooming asters.
Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy of Science – 9.15.2023
The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy is a hilarious commentary intertwined with thoughtful philosophy, around the significance of humans and planet Earth. It started as a BBC radio play that gained a cult following, and became a TV series, movie and quintet of books. The author, Douglas Adams, rewrote the material many times, so the plot and order of events changes depending on the medium. I would recommend the books. I read the entire series to my daughter when she was in high school, and we both laughed a lot, even though some of the humor is British or a bit historic. For example, the main non-earth character named themself Ford Prefect.
A Number of Things – 9.8.2023
When I was little, every Friday, my mom went to the Central News Agency store to pick up a bundle of magazines that had come to South Africa by ship from England. Among these were three for children – my brother got Boys Own, my sister got Bunty, both on newsprint and with contents considered appropriate for boys or girls. I was the youngest and got Jack and Jill, printed in glorious full color. There were stories, puzzles and two items I liked best. One was the Village in the Morning, and the Village in the Evening. The same view of some idyllic hamlet, drawn with cottages, shops in the center, a schoolhouse, surrounded by lush fields with sheep and a gentle river. The village was populated by children, moms who stayed home, and dads who worked elsewhere (and of course, no ethnic, gender or racial diversity was depicted). In the morning there was the milkman on his rounds, there were the children walking to school, moms getting wash on the line, and then off to the greengrocer or butcher. Shopkeepers were opening their stores with attractive displays of vegetables, meats, and groceries. And side by side was the early evening picture, dads coming home, children playing outside in the dusk, moms taking a pie out of the oven and stirring the pot of delicious supper. It was clearly not real, even to me as a child living in Apartheid South Africa, where most of the population did not have enough food, decent housing or schooling. But I hoped the cozy pictures could someday, in some way, be real for everyone in my country.
Summer Reading – 8.25.2023
At the very end, on reflection, how has your summer been? New England has been not too hot, and plenty of rain has made up for the lack of snow last winter. But earlier, massive rain devastated parts of Vermont, and elsewhere, extreme heat and fires, including in Maui, have made for huge hardship and challenge. I hope your family and friends in affected areas are safe. I hope despite this bad news, your summer has been mostly positive.
Good Dogs – 7.28.2023
Without dogs, my life would have had more stress, less love and might well have taken a different path. I’m amazed that one can have a deep friendship with another species, and that with a dog we can share huge emotion, understanding and caring.
Golden Age of Science 6.30.23
This week a tooth infection flared up, and I am deeply grateful for helpful antibiotics and an expert endodontist attending to the future of my tooth. How different than the 1500’s encapsulated by summer viewing of The Tudors and Henry VIII (or Six, a fun rock retelling to which my daughter pointed me). In those days, the only option was to pull out the poor tooth, without painkillers or clean instruments.
Zoomusicology 5.19.23
Kruger Park is an extraordinary South African national park, comparable in size to Israel or New Jersey, well managed for people and animals. Some years ago, my parents were visiting and there was to be a sunset orchestral concert near a waterhole, that supplied elephants and other animals. As people gathered for the concert, a herd of elephants was finishing up and starting to file away, the matriarch first, then the mothers with babies and the young males last. As they were leaving, the orchestra began to play. My mom said that theelephants all stopped, stood for a minute and then the matriarch turned and led her group back to the side of the waterhole.
Sustainability 5.12.23
Do you know what a CO2 pipeline is? Me neither, until Wednesday when I heard an NPR item on the topic. The premise is that CO2 produced by human activities can be prevented from leaking into the atmosphere, through transport along pipelines to permanent underground storage facilities. Sounds complex and questionably effective. The pipelines, like other types – oil, natural gas for example, can be dangerous and can rupture. There are ~5,000 miles of CO2pipelines in the US presently, scheduled to be increased more than ten-fold in the next few years, with pipes often traversing disadvantaged areas.
Graduation Celebration 5.5.23

Congratulations! to all COS Tier 1 Awardees! And thank you! to faculty who contributed to the important Humanics Workshop this week.
Seasons Change – 4.21.23
Archer, our very senior dog can manage only a short evening walk now, but we always pass a tree that I’ve been rooting for, so to speak, almost all its life. It was planted around a decade ago and confronted by 80 inches of snow that first winter. The snow bent the trunk almost vertically downward, and I thought it would snap. But in spring, to my amazement, the trunk more or less straightened, and the tree made a few leaves.
Spring Clean Up – 4.14.23
It’s been around twenty years since we did home renovations. The basement bathroom is disintegrating, the original 1938 kitchen cabinets drip sawdust, floor tiles treacherously protrude, the roof leaks and yesterday, the front steps collapsed. So, we have embarked on a home improvement strategic plan, with exciting findings. For example, demolition of the basement bathroom revealed that one wall was only a sheet of now-rotten wood, that when removed revealed a creepy underground passage extending deep into the earth. Of course, fixing this required unanticipated investment in a sturdy cinder block wall and some loads of earth. Renovations come with their close partner – Clean Up.
Traditions – 4.7.23
Passover is the tradition I know best this time of year, that involves some unique foods. The dish called haroset represents the mortar that enslaved Israelites in Egypt used for building. Haroset often includes finely chopped nuts and apples, but the rest is open for play. My mom made hers with walnuts, raisins, apples and wine but it was a little bitter and watery, so I evolved a version with pecans, dates, raisins, apples and honey which is totally delicious and has become a new family tradition.
Help, Spring – 3.31.23
And this week, the sleepiness of Winter in the natural world rapidly dissipated. On Krentzman Quad the allium bulbs have sprouted, and rabbits are enjoying the bright shoots. A neighbor’s garden is a carpet of snowdrops and little blue star flowers whose name I don’t know. And my favorite chipmunks, having been cuddled up in their burrows, are venturing out. There is a lot of scurrying in Spring, and how wonderful are the longer days.
Women in Science – 3.24.23
Let me ask you: how has it been to be a woman in science? And this question is for anyone who identifies as a woman in the College of Science, faculty or staff. It’s a big sample size. So how is it going? How has it been? Do you have a story or two to demonstrate? I have a basketful of anecdotes on the topic.
We have a Plan! - 3.17.23
Way back, on October 21, 2022, I shared with you that we were launching a Strategic Planning process. I shared that our plan would address important contributions of the College of Science to the future of academic science and the future of Northeastern University, supporting the Northeastern academic plan. And I shared that it would be a plan from us all, with the opportunity for input from every College member.
Hands-In - 3.3.23
Every day, we give our College of Science students opportunities way beyond a two-foot square plot, but the idea is the same. Learn by routing about, hands-in, growing to understand where you want to put your talent and time. Thank you and congratulations! to every staff member, every faculty member for contributing to our important, wonderful experiential landscape.
The Winter Bear - 2.24.23
One of my favorite books (geared to all of us young readers) is The Winter Bear. It has lovely illustrations, perfect for this time of year, where the skeletons of trees stand out, there are bits of snow, and a pale sun. It’s also a perfect story because the arc is so clear: three children go for a walk, find a stuffed bear stuck in a tree, run home amidst a sudden snowstorm, and install the bear in a cozy armchair. Any story with a clear arc is satisfying, even comforting, where the beginning, middle and end are seamlessly linked. (There is a beautiful song of similar name with a pretty good arc, if you look).
Listening - 2.17.23
Let’s ask one another, and carefully listen to the answer: How is your week going?tell me what’s on your mind.
Let’s not be satisfied with a one-word answer: Good or Okay or Busy Let’s ask more: What’s been the best part? What’s been the biggest challenge? And if it seems right: How can I make your week better? Listening, and being heard, may be the things that count most towards belonging, and in our work to be “A Diverse College where Everyone Belongs”. I am eager to listen, pleasethe Three Laws of Robotics - 2.10.23
The very recent earthquake that has had devastating impacts in Syria and Turkey is fresh in our minds. Warmest wishes to those of you with family and friends in these areas, and we pray that each of your loved ones is safe.
You’ve surely heard of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence platform that can interact with you online (a ‘chatbot’). ChatGPT is particularly talented at understanding questions and formulating information, including adequately writing some homework assignments. There is excitement and alarm over theplatform, including how it may undermine academic honesty.
ChatGPT - 2.03.23
This week marks the start of Black History Month, on a somber note as we are reminded yet again of the horrendous systemic racism persisting in our country. A Black man, Tyre Nichols died after a brutal beating by police following a routine traffic stop. The episode makes me weep. We must affirm that in the College of Science and at Northeastern University, we embrace a culture of respect, where each person is valued for their contribution and is treated equitably, and where each person belongs. We oppose racism. We do not tolerate any form of discrimination. We strive to have diverse membership and commit to promoting equity and anti-racist policies through education and action.
Spring Semester - 1.27.2023
This week has brought devastating news of shootings in California, and the horror of Tyre Banks killing is beginning to unfold, among other troubling events. I hope your loved ones are safe. Jupiter. Would that dilute our issues, by spreading them around a greater area, or would more appear to fill the space? About 1300 earths could fit into the volume of Jupiter. The planet is no target for human habitation – mostly helium and hydrogen gas, liquid deep below to make a huge, electrified ocean. Did you know that Jupiter’s day is only ten hours, making it the fastest-spinning planet in the solar system?
When the task list seems too daunting, when the troubles across the world seem too much, I sometimes escape by wondering what life would be like if Earth were the size ofHelpful - 1.20.2023
‘Helpful’ is wonderful. Someone who can turn unclear into understanding, who can answer questions, who can give fair support. And don’t be shy to ask for help, in my experience, the answer is almost always positive. Sometimes the request for help is distant, but real. Our Food Drive and your outstanding response was helpful in such a way. Thank you for contributing! Sometimes, there is ‘co-helpful’ that goes in both directions, and both people involved in the discussion are assisted.
CONNECTIONS to the Future - 1.13.2023
Trying to keep track of science in the news is both inspiring and daunting. Every week, our COS Monday CONNECTS highlights some of the important publications and grants from members of our community. You can find science news aggregators, but I draw on what’s in several regular newspapers. As usual, news this week divides into good, bad, and interesting.
Satellites - 12.9.22
I love the flight path indicator on a plane, to see how high and fast you’re flying and where. Particularly fun is the full earth globe you can rotate, to look at places that are nowhere near your destination, but exotic possibilities. All this comes from satellite images, and Google Earth is a fantastic use of these data, despite some privacy concerns. That you can find your house, check out another location, or get (mostly correct) directions is terrific. In the excellent movie Lion, Google Earth helped Saroo find his home. My house shows up with a swing set from long ago in the garden. Google Earth is a great example of where science, engineering and computation can meet, with stunning application. Indeed, satellites are one of the few realizations of space technology that exceed predictions of science fiction, which by now would have projected we could all readily zip around the universe.
Collaboration - 12.2.22
My first collaboration was during an undergraduate research project, titled ‘An Investigation into the Effect of Crowding on Growth of Xenopus laevis Tadpoles’, a creative melding between the fields of ecology and developmental biology. Turns out that crowded tadpoles grow less rapidly than those spread out, and my project was to figure out why. I thought that the crowded populations might eat less than uncrowded and measured this using a radioactive tracer. Later, I harvested each tadpole and counted the number of radioactive emissions. There were hundreds of tadpoles, so I got lots of data, and had no idea what to do with it. My advisor told me to do statistics, but I had no idea what that meant. You need a collaborator! he said and sent me to his colleague in the Math department. It was a bit daunting, but the senior Professor listened respectfully and kindly as I explained the point of the project, what data I’d collected, and how I had been advised to do statistics. He recommended using the Students T-Test, writing on a piece of lined paper the steps to figure out whether crowded and uncrowded tadpoles ate significantly different amounts. (They did not, so a re-think was needed there). I was so grateful for the guidance, and that collaboration was an empowering life event.
Get One's Teeth Into - 11.18.22
My second-grade friend Beverly and I were playing an innovative follow-the-leader game around the house, one with eyes open leading the other with eyes closed. Walking side by side, Beverly leading me, I suddenly collided hard with something, jolting my head and front teeth. Turned out, Beverly had walked through a door, and I had walked into the wall beside it. My mom drove me to Dr. Hotz the dentist, who said luckily the teeth were not shattered, although one front tooth was missing a chunk and there was a crack across the one next door. The chunk is still missing, the memory indelible.
Honor - 11.4.22
Walking by Curry last week, I was thrilled to see Cooper and his handler NUPD Officer Rachel Joliffe coming towards me. As you likely know, Cooper is a magnificent golden retriever who nonchalantly accepts the love of hundreds of Northeastern students, faculty and staff every day. There’s something about a sweet dog that gets deep into the soul and comforts. As we approach Veterans Day this year, which has the theme of Honor, we acknowledge the terrible aftermath of combat on our troops. Service dogs can be enormously helpful for veterans, although the funding to train these dogs has not yet been approved at the federal level.
Underworld of Traffic - 10.28.22
Driving along route nine this week was a descent into the underworld – blazing red lights amidst dense foggy rain, the pace glacial. Van Halen on WZLX could not make a dent. But along that road there’s a spot where a movie from my mind pops up, that conjured away the fog. It’s a balmy summer afternoon, after my daughter’s impressive trapeze performance at circus camp, and we’re driving home, suddenly very hungry. Rosie’s Bakery is conveniently right there, and we opt for a large box of apricot rugelach, right out of the oven. Back in the car, we eat almost all of them, a beyond perfect bite, that can still brighten a gloomy rush hour.
Planning Strategically - 10.21.22
At its best, goal setting can be a mind-stretching, useful exercise – an opportunity to reflect, synthesize and think deeply about next steps. When the mind is free and playful, creative ways to do business, new ideas and important insights can result.
As you know, I’ve set goals for the College of Science that are specific enough to give us direction, and general enough to allow evolution:
- Commit to a Culture of Respect and Action towards Equity
- Communicate the Good Power of Science
- Solve the Greatest Research Challenges
- Promote Innovative and Global Education
- Reinvent the PhD
- Increase Undergraduate Research
- Build an Entrepreneurship Landscape
- Define Space and Work for the Future
We’ve made excellent progress in most categories and are poised to address others.
Animal Experimentation - 10.14.22
This week you might have read how human neurons, the cells that receive and send signals around the nervous system had been implanted into a rat brain. The human neurons thrived and integrated into the rat brain so that when they were stimulated, the rat’s behavior changed. This is another step in the surprising understanding that cells can ‘self-organize’ to form small bits of human organs, called ‘organoids’. These can assist in understanding disease and devising treatments that can help. In this study, to assess function, the brain organoid was implanted into a rat brain. Is it ethical to use rats as hosts for human neurons, possibly bits of the human brain? How much of the rat brain can, and should maximally, be replaced by human cells? The answers to these complex questions include data and opinion, ethics, in other words.
Bravery - 10.7.22
In the building where I used to work, there was an alcove that was a nesting place for falcons. For a while, a falcon cam allowed community members to spy on the lovely birds even before they hatched. We saw the babies learn to pull apart a pigeon or duck their parent had provided, we watched their down replaced by big bird feathers. And we watched the adolescent falcons gearing up to fly. They would stretch their wings and run back and forth along the length of their space, getting the feel. After some days, if you were lucky, you could catch one of them standing at the edge of the alcove where it opened to the sky, flapping its wings, taking a little hop forward and then a hop back to safety. You could see the bird getting up courage, becoming brave enough to take the first flight. I never saw that but did see the nest empty next day. On the Novartis building across the street, were two falcons perching on the sign. They took off, circled and came back, maybe parent and fledgling, and the day after they were gone.
Freedoms - 9.30.22
Freedom is a well-used word that carries weight, promise and challenge. I like the notion of three types of freedom: “freedom from,” a freedom from constraints; “freedom to,” a freedom to do what we want to do; and “freedom to be,” not just to do what we want, but a freedom to be who we are. Then there are the Four Freedoms proposed by President Franklin D Roosevelt in 1941: freedom of speech and expression; freedom of worship; freedom from want and freedom from fear. All of these can provide a useful framework for real events, as Associate Dean for Equity, Randall Hughes and I discussed this week.
Taking Time to Play - 9.23.22
Last week I joined a tour of the CILS Imaging Facility in ISEC, with the expert guidance of Professor James Monaghan (Biology). CILS is an important part of the Northeastern research landscape, and the Imaging Facility is wonderful, with highest tech microscopes, that can see deep into cells, often in a living animal. There are microscopes for K-12 students to experience the magic of imaging through Biobus-Northeastern, led by Assistant Professor Vivek Venkatachalam (Physics) and James Monaghan. It’s the best imaging facility in Boston, and a great place to play.
Finding Time for Yourself - 9.16.22
What an unbelievably busy, complex beginning of the semester. Regarding the Holmes Hall incident on Tuesday night, multiple law enforcement agencies have determined that the campus is safe and secure. As you know classes, research, and all other campus activities resumed on Wednesday, and continue. There is an ongoing investigation into the incident. ‘Quiet quitting’ is such a new term that Google searches for this began only in August. The idea though is not so new, and the term seems to mean ‘doing the minimum to keep your job’.
Welcome to the New Year! - 9.9.22
There is Mr. Dundon, handing out blue notebooks for the new year – Saxonwold School, fourth grade. You know them, flimsy blue 5×8 lined notebooks, with deep significance because they are a chance for perfection. Unmarked, pristine, waiting to begin a flawless year. Of course, by lunchtime (cheese and tomato sandwich, apple) that path is lost, my name written crookedly on the cover and the first page already including crossings out. No surprise really. But the opportunity to be better, possibly perfect, in every new year never stops being enticing.
‘How is your Summer?’ 7.29.22
There are some bad things happening. Severe heat, terrible fires, and floods. Ongoing revelations about the shameful January 6 post-election events. Devastating fallout from rescinding abortion rights. Further racial violence. Harm and ominous threats to the LGBTQ+ community. COVID in its next wave, relentlessly continuing to impact so many lives. If you get sick, please rest plenty and take care until you are better.
Helping to Fly the Plane - 8.26.22
One time, I was on a flight from Seattle to Phoenix, when darkness started moving down my head – from the top, into my forehead and approaching my eyes. I felt pressed into the seat, and it was hard to breathe. My first thought was that I was ill, but a glance at my neighbor showed she was feeling the same. A flight attendant was running up the aisle. Without warning the plane went into a steep descent and in seconds we could breathe, and the darkness was gone. Sometime later there was an announcement that we had lost pressure, and that both primary and backup systems had failed. Aha. My second thought was where were the oxygen masks? It seemed the perfect opportunity for these to deploy.
A Troubling Start to Summer - 5.27.22
Whatever may be imperfect about our k-12 education system, school is wonderful. Caring teachers help you learn interesting things, you make some friends, and there is free breakfast and lunch if you need it. For some kids, school is a safer, less stressful place than home. And school is there, a reliable destination that parents count on every day.
Power of Community - 5.20.22
This past week has been all about the power of Community. Northeastern Commencement at Fenway last Friday was brilliant: a mix of academic gravitas and joyous celebration. Our COS students all shone, but two stood out as part of the platform presentations. Tolu Faderin, a Behavioral Neuroscience major, gave a wrenchingly beautiful performance of the National Anthem, while Adwoa Sefah, a Cell and Molecular Biology major was the brilliant undergraduate student speaker. When I greeted College of Science graduates, their roar of celebration was also a shout of knowing that they belonged here in the College of Science at Northeastern University. Because of your teaching and mentoring, they will carry with them the good power of science and find a vast set of career possibilities. Congratulations!!
Reinventing the PhD - 5.13.22
You surely remember your experience as a PhD student, and now, as faculty or staff you may have contact with our College of Science PhD trainees and see how they are doing. I remember being honored to have the opportunity of a place in graduate school, and incredulous that it was sponsored. The research was interesting but difficult, and I worked incredibly hard, sometimes alone in the lab at night and generally lonely. I had no idea what came next. My thesis is on a Richards office bookshelf, and although I’m proud of the work, I would say my PhD training was a mixed experience.
Addressing Commencement - 5.6.22
This week, I am thinking what to tell our students in the College of Science Commencement Ceremony next Tuesday evening. Thank you to everyone participating! Thank You Enormously to Assistant Dean Amber Watson and Associate Director for Graduate Administration Melissa Rubock for their huge and expert work in organizing this.
Writing a talk is always interesting. There should be a thread, and one take home message. The beginning is key. If you lose your audience then, you’ve lost them for good. There should be an arc and a return to the beginning to give a polished finish. I love to build talks out loud and to try lots of beginnings. Most get thrown out. But I don’t worry, because there’s so much possibility, so many stories to tell. At some point ideas coalesce and there’s the thread.
Northeastern Burlington Innovation Campus - 4.29.22
This Tuesday, a group of us (me, Associate Dean Erin Cram, Associate Dean Sam Inman, and Assistant Director of Space Planning and Safety Sarah Stanton) took a trip to our Northeastern Innovation Campus at Burlington. Burlington is a close Network site, but quite different from the hustle of our Boston campus. I’ve visited multiple times and admired the Life Sciences Testing Center, but without the full tour. For now, there is free parking, and the 14-acres is open and quiet. We connected with Associate Dean Jared Auclair, who is also Director of BATL, and runs an industry-focused research group at Burlington; Peter Boynton, CEO, George J. Kostas Institute (KRI); and Professor Deniz Erdogmus, CTO, KRI.
Urban Wildlife - 4.22.22
Right outside my kitchen door on Tuesday was a turkey. It was smart in glossy brown, striped and spotted feathers, making its gobbling sound. My yard is fenced to keep the dog in, but the turkey had entered somehow, and now looked contemplatively at the neighbor’s yard. It’s amazing to me that turkeys can fly at all, given their shape, but it must be true, for in a moment the turkey was next door. Urban wildlife seems very important. Our urbane, campus squirrels foraging outside Cabot, the rabbits on the lawns by Curry, the confident robins all over, and bumble bees bravely seeking out Northeastern flowers outside Richards. They give us a true glimpse into a different life. For most people (and 70% of us now live in cities), it may be the only wildlife you see. The privilege of seeing an elephant or kudu in the wild is rare, and even in a zoo it’s not so frequent, and can you truly love and respect animals you’ve never seen for real?
Evolution and Religion - 4.15.22
When I was 21 and teaching Science in Neasden High School, London, I was volunteered for a debate titled ‘Evolution vs Religion’. The venue was one of the science labs, which was incredibly noisy and packed with kids. My opponent was a dapper math teacher, who vociferously laid out his case that evolution was a failed theory, and that creation was the only truth. Armed with undergraduate knowledge, I bravely represented natural selection as more than a theory, but he was well-equipped with rhetoric. When the bell rang, my adversary huffed off, declaring himself victor.
Awards - 4.8.22
The ability to understand a reward goes way back in animal evolution, well before animals with backbones arose. The reward system is part of how we’re motivated to get things done and includes some powerful neural circuits. Unfortunately, these same circuits become mis-directed in opioid or other addictive disorders. In our day to day, as you know, rewards acknowledge something well done, like a small cup of salted caramel ice-cream when you finish putting together next week’s homework problems or submit a Report on time. Awards are often more public than Rewards, often less delicious, and usually more formal with a citation. There are fewer Awards than rewards but let me say that every person in the College of Science deserves an Award for Important Contributions Made in AY21-22. Congratulations! to each of you, for how you contribute, collaborate, and connect across the College of Science and Northeastern University.
Discovering the Unexpected - 4.1.22
How do you know what you don’t know? At a deep level, understanding something really new is the foundation of scientific discovery. You poke around at the edge of your knowledge, and maybe a bit cracks open to reveal something unexpected. discovery of the antibiotic penicillin is a paradigm, uncovered after a lab bench was left uncleaned for a couple of weeks. Dr. Alexander Fleming was the owner of the bench, and he might just have tidied the mess and moved on. But, and here’s what’s important, before he cleaned up, he noticed that some two-week old bacterial cultures had become infected with mold, and that the mold was killing the disease-causing bacteria. The mold contained the chemical penicillin, that went on to save more than a hundred million lives. It was careful looking and thinking about effects of vacation time on the bacteria that was crucial.
Unexpected discoveries in science are thrilling. TheSpring! - 3.25.22
The topic is Spring. The word is Frenetic. It’s true in our schedules, and I feel like one of the birds in my garden, spending the entire day collecting, strategizing, doing. I know each of you is inundated with deadlines and challenges. As always, please accept my most sincere thanks for dealing with the huge workload, I know it is a lot. Please remember that your contribution is truly important to building the Good Power of Science.
Spring is a reliable, expansive, explosion of cell division and growth, of every living thing waking up and getting going. Almost every religion or culture celebrates Spring. The push is enormous, as emphasized by a tree I passed once in Jamaica Plain, its base encased in concrete, harshly pruned to accommodate wires and walls, nonetheless enthusiastically sending out pale leaves and pink blossoms.
Bennett's Comet - 3.18.22
Long ago, at exactly this time in March, Bennett’s Comet swung by the Southern Hemisphere, discovered by an amateur astronomer. I was deeply interested in the stars myself and would spend evenings scanning the skies with binoculars and copy of The Southern Stars by Patrick Moore. It was a huge thrill to find some blurs near the horizon that were probably the Magellanic Clouds, companion dwarf galaxies to our Milky Way. Wanting more magnification, I saw an advertisement in Scientific American for a book called Amateur Telescope Making and my dad allowed me to order it. It was a small book covered in grey paper, even today on my bookshelf. The local planetarium sold supplies, and following directions, I ground my own lenses by rotating two six-inch discs of glass against one another, so one became concave (the lens) and one convex. Next steps involved polishing the lens with increasingly fine emery paper and rouge, and then coating it with silver (from reduced silver nitrate) to make a mirror. The culmination was mounting the lens in a cardboard tube and attaching an eye piece. It didn’t matter that the lens was not successful, and nothing was in focus, the thrill of having made my own telescope was enough.
A celebration of women - 3.11.22
Although International Women’s Day may smell like a commercially constructed event, in fact its origins go back to 1909. According to Wikipedia, “International Women’s Day (IWD) is a global holiday celebrated annually on March 8 to commemorate the cultural, political, and socioeconomic achievements of women. It is also a focal point in the women’s rights movement, bringing attention to issues such as gender equality, reproductive rights, and violence and abuse against women.”
Boulevard of Broken Dreams - 3.4.22
The pandemic has been amongst the ten worst experienced by humanity. There is nothing to counter the conclusion that this has been a defining event in each of our lives, whose damage will not fully go away, except perhaps for the youngest kids. The past two years have been, in the words of Green Day, a ‘Boulevard of Broken Dreams’. The link to their official, bleak video shows the song as a brilliant anthem of loneliness and despair. But now, check out another version, the live performance at a huge concert, where with the opening chords, fifty thousand young people sing in unison, the entire song. Frontman Billie Joe Armstrong gives them the mic. The faces of the crowd are joyous, because singing out the words together makes everyone feel much better, much less lonely.
Updates on Diversity and Inclusion - 2.25.22
The invasion of Ukraine is very bad news, and for those of you with family and friends in the region, our warmest wishes and prayers for their safety. What a worrying time.
In the wake of new legislation and policies this week in Texas and Florida, we affirm our College of Science commitment to an equitable, diverse and inclusive community, our support for the LGBTQIA+ community, including transgender people and their families.
Randall Hughes, Associate Dean for Equity and I provide this update for you on key new initiatives to promote a culture of respect and equity in the College of Science:
- Educating and informing our community to prevent discrimination and harassment
Discrimination and harassment are not tolerated in the College of Science. Each person belongs in our College, regardless of race, color, religion, religious creed, genetic information, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, national origin, ancestry, veteran or disability status.
Further, retaliation will not be tolerated against any person who in good faith makes a report of a prohibited offense. Any person who retaliates directly or indirectly against a victim, witness, person reporting a prohibited offense, a respondent and/or charged party, or any person involved in the investigation of a prohibited offense will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination (if an employee) or expulsion (if a student).
Job Descriptions - 2.18.22
In a broad view, everything alive has a job, even if there is no written JD. What’s the job of your students? I asked one semester, and each found it valuable to lay out personal reasons and goals for their university education. How about a third grader? A baby? Your dog? An ant? That’s a provocative one. Gather food and materials, build the nest, keep it clean. Work as a team. Protect the pack. Sound familiar?! If we could ask, a tree would likely write that its JD is to make food, produce seeds, fend off insect attacks, and connect with other trees. On the other hand, you might think that a tree’s job is to provide shade and wood, and to help modulate the climate, highlighting an important thing about JDs. They can depend on your perspective. What you think is your job, may not be the same as your supervisor’s view, which is why goal setting and mid-year reviews are useful all around.
The Excellence of Snow - 2.11.22
Science is the Olympics of discovery and application. The teacher who constructs a course with elegance and insight, the researcher addressing a question with stunning logic and brilliant interpretation, are some of our Gold Medalists. Often, we play team sports, working together to the finish line of scientific solutions. Excellence in Science is as breath-taking as Chloe Kim’s half-pipe skill or Nathan Chen’s quads. It’s what we work towards. But we know that in the Olympics, most athletes win no medals, and even being able to stay upright while skating on your local rink counts a lot! Everyone’s contribution is award-winning when it comes to promoting excellence in our College and at Northeastern University, across teaching, research, and expert administration. Thank you everyone for participating in the Winter Olympics of Science!
The Wheel of Time - 2.4.22
Like fantasy villages, in the College of Science, we often know each other’s names (and can readily introduce ourselves!), and when we need special help, we seek out the expert – in HR, Grants Administration and so on. Indeed, our culture of respect values each person as an individual who brings their expertise and diverse background to fulfill our mission. Much of our expertise is held in Departments, which are ‘collections of expertise’, each of which is a ‘discipline,’ meaning ‘a branch of knowledge’. The notion of scientific disciplines stretches back to the dawn of universities, and has become labeled as a dusty, old-fashioned concept. This is totally wrong. Far from being dusty, disciplines are vibrant collections of state-of-the-art expertise, that can be put together with that from other disciplines, to learn something wonderful. No-one can know everything, that’s why we have scholars who understand algebraic geometry, quantum theory, stem cells, molecular structure, brain circuitry or coastal ecosystems. Understanding how to use this knowledge requires another type of discipline, the hard work kind, that always has valuable outcomes, and why our trainees benefit from some disciplinary education.
Building with Cells - 1/28/22
If you have a penchant to build your own house, here’s an 800 page book that will guide you through. To build something larger, say EXP, that we are joyfully watching rise on Columbus Ave, you will need expert input, a lot of money and detailed plans. The largest construction project underway on planet Earth may be ITER, a massive fusion reactor in France, that will produce net energy, projected for completion in 2025. Plans for ITER likely run ten thousand pages, and include thousands of expert workers, $25+ billion and 35 countries.
But actually, ITER is not the most complex engineering project around. No. So what is? Look in the mirror! It’s you! Building a person is way more complex than any human-made construction. And there is no crew to hire, no book of plans to purchase. Rather, people get built all the time, quickly, perfectly and at pretty low cost, raising the question of how the hugely successful Construction Industry of Life works so effectively.
Thank You! - 1/21/22
Across every unit, COS members have been infected with COVID, and the symptoms can be debilitating. Please look after your health, get medical treatment and stay home until you feel better – rest and sleep are essential to full recovery. In our recent Community Meeting, we named this the ‘Supportive Semester’ as faculty and staff of the College support one another and are supported across Northeastern. Please let your department or program chair, or your manager know if you have to be away, and be in touch with me or one of our Associate Deans as needed.
Please reach out with worries, needs and ideas.
Come by the Dean’s Office if you need a mask, some candy, a hello, help.
Civil Rights - 1/14/22
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. played a pivotal role in promoting freedoms for African American people, advocating non-violence and civil disobedience. In 1964, at age 35, Dr. King won the Nobel Peace Prize. The world was shocked at his assassination on April 4, 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee. Martin Luther King Jr. Day was established as a holiday in cities and states throughout the United States beginning in 1971, and at the federal level in 1986.
This coming Monday we respectfully honor the contributions of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to the Civil Rights Movement. This year we have a small relief that some justice was served in two cases where civil rights were violated: the murderers of George Floyd and of Ahmaud Arbery have been convicted and sentenced. In our College, we continue to build a landscape of respect and belonging, with action towards equity and justice. We stand strong against racism, and towards policies of justice in the College of Science and at Northeastern University.
Welcome to 2022! - 1/7/22
We are entering the Spring semester with uncertainty and challenge, as you know. In our powerful Northeastern pandemic tradition, we will be in person, and I’m optimistic that we will manage. Projections from our Network Science Institute led by Prof. Alessandro Vespignani indicate that the Omicron surge will peak by mid-January, which is good news for the rest of the semester. But some of you and your families will become infected, and some of your students. Please use high quality N95 or KN94/95 masks to help protect yourselves. How will you help absent students continue their learning, how will you cover your class or other work if you need to quarantine or are feeling ill? How can we encourage students who have lost so much opportunity for learning? All the while, please pay attention to your well-being. Running the semester is a huge responsibility, and the only way we’ll succeed is by working together and supporting one another. Further thoughts are below, and we’ll discuss this in our COS Community Meeting next week.
Warmest Wishes for a Peaceful Holiday - 12/17/21
It is stunning how tough this year has been. Again. We pray that your family and friends in Kentucky and neighboring states are safe. How relentless the bad news, the demands, the challenges. It is stunning how hard you are all working. But it’s also stunning to see your successes. Every week I am thrilled to learn of your innovative teaching approaches. Of outstanding advising. Of top-quality organization and stewardship across the College. Of donations from wonderful supporters. I’m honored to see the prestigious awards and research grants our faculty have won. Every week I learn of your amazing research findings. In this tough time, the power of Higher Education, of Good Science and our work has only increased in importance – to guide students towards a productive yet peaceful life, and to contribute solutions towards the toughest problems on earth. As the late bell hooks said in Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom: “The classroom remains the most radical space of possibility in the academy”.
The Magic of Science - 12/10/21
Some years ago, I organized a conference on Developmental Biology and set it to music. The opener was ‘It’s a Kind of Magic’, by my favorite band Queen. The audience seemed taken aback at being blasted with rock music, but I wanted to acknowledge that the embryo seems truly magical. Every talk was based on the extraordinary truth that each of us came from one tiny starter cell, that made 100 trillion more cells, and those built themselves into your organs, which connect seamlessly to make your whole self. Check out the amazing process in zebrafish. Though I’ve worked in the field for decades, the magic (and music) never diminish for me, even though we know actual mechanisms involved.
Restfulness and Obligation - 12/3/21
It is the nightmare of every family, every friend. Someone you love goes out and does not come home. Ahmaud Arbery went out for a run, and never came home. Some men shot and killed him while he was peacefully jogging, because he was a Black man. Almost, they got away with the murder, but sometimes, our legal system prevails and the murderers were convicted just before Thanksgiving. There is no waking from this nightmare, but there is some justice and retribution to slightly temper the heartbreak of losing Ahmaud Arbery.
I thought about violence and justice while in rural Vermont last week, where I saw almost no-one on my daily walks. There were snowflakes periodically, and bare trees soft grey as they slept. In the winter countryside, the night is wonderfully dark and the quiet almost total. It’s easy to rest there, to be restored and good to remember that the constant barrage of heinous or hateful acts reported in the news does not permeate everywhere. I hope your Thanksgiving was similarly peaceful.
The close of November - 11/19/21
As a wonderful outcome of our work to educate, last weekend saw Commencement 2020. Thousands of students and their families came back, determined to celebrate at their beloved university. On Friday evening, our team of Associate Dean Kevin Thompson, Assistant Dean Amber Watson and myself helped welcome graduates back to Northeastern. Next day, in Matthews Arena, I was so proud to present each COS graduate with an alumni pin, and so proud of student speaker, Bioengineering and Chemistry graduate, and Rhodes Scholar Kritika Singh, accompanied by Prof. Oyinda Oyelaran, one of her mentors. President Aoun recounted the emotional context of shutting down everything back in March 2020, while Chef Ming Tsai urged everyone to make kindness a central part of their lives. Totally. We are all trying so hard, accomplishing, failing, learning, trying again. Being kind and encouraging is the only way to go.
We observe the Thanksgiving holiday with prayers of remembrance and gratitude. We remember those we personally lost, ever loved and in our hearts. We may be filled with gratitude – I am grateful that we can meet in person again, even amidst the continuing COVID threat. I am enormously grateful for your partnership in moving the College of Science forward, for the good of all its members, and for the good of Northeastern University.
Honoring Veterans - 11/12/21
Veterans Day pays tribute to all American veterans – living or dead. It originated on November 11, 1919, the first anniversary of the end of World War I and became a national holiday in 1938. Yet we cannot acknowledge veterans in a meaningful way in just one day. Associate Dean for Equity, Randall Hughes encourages that we should listen to their voices, advocate for mental health and other support, and hold our military and political leaders accountable to address discrimination and harassment in the military.
Power of Higher Education - 11/05/21
Education is wonderful work, important and exciting, but also difficult and intense. And this semester is unlike any other. The COVID-class of students is upon us. Across multiple departments, I am hearing of students not equipped to deal with their academics, perhaps because the last two years of high school involved lackluster online learning, even cheating, just to get by in the frightening, unreal pandemic. And that missing education is showing now, across all levels. It puts a huge stress on students not equipped for their rigorous Northeastern academics. And it puts a huge stress on you, our faculty, who are burned out, even mid-way through the semester, after eighteen months of relentless and changing teaching needs, and sometimes larger class sizes to meet our huge enrolment increase. What enormous pressure for faculty who are trying to do what you love and to meet your own high standards under difficult circumstances. Thank you to everyone in our departments who is strategizing how to help students succeed in their classes and qualifications, in the face of these unprecedented challenges.
Balancing Time - 10/29/21
I’ve never understood the term ‘work-life balance’. Are we not alive while at work? Sometimes this is called ‘work-leisure balance’. For those of you who rush home to the unpaid job of parenting or other caregiving, the notion of work-leisure balance is a bad joke. But there is something important here – a comfortable time distribution between your job in the Northeastern College of Science and the rest – maybe an ‘individual time balance’.
In the odd ‘work-life balance’ term, there’s a ‘work is bad’ connotation, that is wrong for me, and I hope for all of you. I think work is wonderful! What a great opportunity we have – to empower students and to promote the highest quality research in the framework of good Science. Working together, we are building excellence in every sphere. Every job in our College is important, and thank you everyone, for your contributions to meeting our exciting, groundbreaking College and Northeastern University goals.
The Languages of Science - 10/22/21
How do we build the future of the COS? I like building from the ground up, so started by asking ‘what is a College of Science’? Interestingly, I could find no general definition, so looked more broadly for definitions of ‘Science’ . The results were totally boring, for example: ‘Science (from Latin scientia ‘knowledge’) is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the world’.
Is ‘Science’ then, and our College of Science an artificial construct, or a relic from long ago? Absolutely not! There is a living, important and wonderful framework for Science, and for a College of Science. Some time ago, I formulated a set of “Great Languages” and ranked them according to broadest usage. There is no judgment in this ranking, just a semi-quantitative ‘usage’ metric, and it’s fun to use different size fonts to represent usage. My terming of language is “a set of related concepts and principles, forming a grammar and vocabulary, that can be used to communicate, create and answer questions”.
By this schema, the most used Great Languages are Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry since they are languages of the entire Universe. Biology is certainly the language of our planet, governing all life on earth. The ‘Human Languages’, no less important to people, are the ones you might think of first – Spanish, English, Chinese etc together with the languages of humanities, arts and design – Philosophy, History, Music etc. Coding comprises a set of recent languages, with increasing usage. Engineering is a powerful synthesis of many languages. My fellow Deans can frame the crucial landscapes of their Colleges brilliantly, the only goal here is to frame the College of Science.
Gender Equity - 10/15/21
Our faculty members include brilliant women across every sphere of Science and at every level. But we need to worry why women are so poorly represented in many departments. For example, in the tenure stream, our Physics and Mathematics department faculty run below 15% women, and in Chemistry only 25%. These numbers are representative of most universities indicating the attrition of talented women in these areas, at stages of training before they would enter academia. The underlying reasons are complex but have a lot to do with expectations from even before birth, early childhood education, k-12 schooling, societal stereotyping, lack of access to affordable childcare, and rigid academic tracks. Our College can’t fix everything, but we can fix academic landscapes – we think that women faculty percentages will increase after reworking archaic practices, by hiring right out of the PhD, by hiring cohorts, promoting collaborative research and devising tenure assessments that acknowledge teamwork. All of course, within a culture of respect, where everyone listens carefully to one another, and respects the contributions of every College member.
Celebrating the Truth - 10/08/21
You may remember the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell’s book 1984. They had the job to rewrite history, so it fit the propaganda. It was where Winston Smith worked, who became so disgusted with his assignment and society that he sought to escape, and find the real truth (unfortunately, with no happy ending).
I wonder often what is ‘real’. When I need something unequivocal, the maple tree in my yard is a help – the rough bark under each finger and the view up the high trunk confirm with every sense that this is real. But assessing the truth behind news reports, history, or anecdotes is so difficult that ‘fake news’ is now a scholarly field.
Tenure - 10/01/21
By the time I came up for tenure consideration, what I cared about was that my research group had made really interesting findings. We had asked how organs of the body get put in the correct place, or as a student subtitled his thesis: ‘why your brain is not in your big toe’. This topic is both fascinating but also crucial for families seeking causes of birth anomalies. I cared about the wonderfully bright group of trainees who had chosen to work with me, and that I had been able to raise funds to support the work. Tenure was a milestone, but not the point.
The thing you may know about tenure is that it comes with a very long term contract. University tenure is described by the AAUP as originating to protect ‘academic freedom’ allowing faculty the ability to express opinion without fear of retribution. I had thought tenure was like academic regalia, dating back 1,000 years, but actually it is quite new, beginning in the 1940s. Tenure has been criticized as not useful, unfair, and responsible for promoting narrow, elitist research. Indeed, shorter contracts can be a reasonable substitute. But I think with proper understanding and mechanism, tenure remains a viable system, that can maximize the high impact research carried out at a university.
The Slow Way to the Moon - 9/24/21
The only part of the movie AD ASTRA I liked was the beginning, a commercial flight to the moon, that seemed pretty accurate. It looked as uncomfortable as regular air travel, except that pillows and blankets ran $500. When you arrived, there was an escalator, a sign at the top reading Welcome to the Moon (0.10-0.22), and security with dogs in the arrival hall. The car ride after was cool, an open rover driving along the dusty moonscape under a pitch-black sky and earth hanging there. It was not clear how long that future trip took, but generally moon flights carrying people run about three days, and a lot of fuel, to cover the quarter million miles from earth.
Did you know though, that there’s a slow way to the moon? It takes around four weeks and uses much less energy. Rather than the straight shot of escaping earth’s gravity and heading on a direct path to the moon, the slow way puts a craft into increasingly wider elliptical orbit around earth, using earth’s gravity to push the apogee further and further from earth, and closer and closer to the moon. Eventually the craft is captured by the moon’s gravity and switches into moon orbit. It’s very clever and although the distance traveled approaches four million miles, the trip costs a fraction of the straight shot.
The BeeGees and the importance of collaborative research - 9/17/21
You’ve likely heard a BeeGees song – the 2017 estimate was that one of their hits played on the radio every twenty seconds. I had vaguely discounted them as a run of the mill pop group until I came across an interview with Barry Gibb, the last living member, and started digging around. In fact, their music is fantastic (click on the *links), and as a bonus, their interesting story suggested some excellent tips for Science research.
From modest beginnings in England, and later Australia, the Gibb brothers – Barry, and twins Maurice and Robin – formed the BeeGees and were pre-teen TV stars with confidence and great harmonies. Back in England the group became hugely successful, largely by popularizing ‘disco’ through their Saturday Night Fever* score (although the genre later became a racist/homophobic target). For 27 consecutive weeks in 1978, seven songs written by the brothers were #1 on the US charts, and they held five of the top ten slots for even longer. Eventually, radio hosts refused to play their songs and held BeeGees-free weekends!
The parallels between the effective BeeGees working style and the important collaborative research we’re promoting at Northeastern are quite interesting. For example…
A Full Experience - 9/10/21
The term ‘normal’ is loaded. Some years ago, my research group explored this as applied to neurodevelopmental and mental health disorders, that our studies address. We quickly decided that ‘normal’ should be removed from our vocabulary, since it implied ‘correct’ or ‘best’ and ‘abnormal’ implied something opposite. In fact, we were part of a wave of understanding, and terminology has become ‘affected’ and ‘unaffected’ as pertain to most disorders. These more recent terms acknowledge differences between people, that although many of us are affected by some mental or physical challenge, none of us is ‘abnormal’, and I am deeply glad that term has dissipated.
‘Normal’ cannot describe this new academic year either, as we cautiously learn to live with COVID. At Convocation on Monday, our new undergraduates, masked and vaccinated, were thrilled to join Northeastern in person, totally excited to be Huskies. President Aoun promised our students a ‘full experience’, which is a brilliant way to put it. On Thursday, we regrouped to hood our PhD candidates – the classes of 2019, 2020, and 2021, becoming one of the few universities to honor doctoral graduates in person. Northeastern has been a paradigm for how to keep the full experience going in the face of a global disaster, and each member of our community should be truly proud to have contributed to this effort.
Important Lives - 8/20/21
You know the scenario – while turning on the shower, a moth flutters up. It’s one of those beautiful white ones with wings carefully outlined in black and small yellow spots on either side. But moths are not built for water, and a drop or two sadly sends the little animal down the drain. Every life is important, and this week brings ongoing news of many lives in danger. In the fires of the western US, earthquakes in Haiti, the turmoil in Afghanistan, tropical storms in our country and abroad, in the rising number of COVID cases. We send warm wishes for the safety of your family and friends in these regions or affected by the virus.
Meetings - 7/23/21
When was your first meeting? Preschool maybe, when you were in the Moonbeam class? Morning Meeting, with a hello song and what was going to happen that day. You picked at your socks, drew on the soles if you had a crayon. Because Morning Meeting was a little slow. And you wanted to get going and do stuff, preferably pedal a tricycle on the outside track as fast as possible.
In the College of Science we broker lots of encounters through meetings. Meetings have a bad reputation – useless, waste of time, too many, are common complaints. But I love well organized meetings that have a point (scroll down in the link to ‘Meeting for Success’). Snappy, carefully led meetings give useful information, unexpected insights and important ideas. Seminars, especially those not in your field, often introduce a technique helpful for your research, and casual meetings are great ways to exchange the latest data.
Ramping up for next semester - 6/25/21
Across the country, we are shocked by the Miami building collapse, and pray for the safety of those affected, and for your family and friends there. We send warm wishes for the safety of your family and friends in countries still so burdened by COVID-19.
In better news, now in official Summer, my bird feeder is in demand from first to last light. Parent birds bring their babies for a snack, and a young bunny comes to look for dropped seeds. The large shallow bowls I’ve filled with water are in constant use for a drink or a splash. Seeds are up and almost flowering, the Borage miraculously returned. Last year I gave up trying to grow a lawn, letting the moss and small plants thrive, and the results are soft, peaceful, and a great environment for insects. But perhaps the best part of summer is pulling on a trusty pair of flipflops, my unconstrained toes enjoying seasonal freedom!
Out of COVID, Into Summer - 5/28/2021
Here in Massachusetts, we have the highest percentage of vaccinated people of any US state, so we are feeling safer and more confident. Restrictions are easing, and at Northeastern in accord with state guidelines, masks will soon be optional everywhere for fully vaccinated people. You are not required to remove your mask. Indeed, for certain medical conditions, the guidance is to be careful. I plan to keep masked in various places, not only because a smart cloth mask has become part of my dress, but because it can be private and protective. Over the upcoming flu and cold season, we all might do well to keep a mask or two at hand. Please do whatever is comfortable, within Northeastern guidelines.
Thank you for the honor of this collegial, productive, mind-expanding first year at Northeastern - 5/21/2021
Almost one year ago, on June 1, 2020, I became your Dean. It was a week after Mr. George Floyd had been murdered by police on May 25, and in the midst of a terrifying global pandemic. Northeastern was new to me, as was our College and almost all of you. I was your fourth Dean in almost the same number of years. It was clear that if we were to go forward in the landscape of racial injustice and within the uncertain pandemic framework, we needed to work together as one Community. We needed an overarching value of respect, with a clear statement against systemic racism and towards an equitable College.
Over the year, we’ve met mostly as 1×1 flat images, and I much look forward to seeing you in person. You’ve come to know me – that I have a funny accent, am very positive, and a hands-on Dean full of ideas, who is always thrilled to hear new ones! I have come to understand the top-quality research that is performed by many of you, the top-quality education you give our students and the top-quality administration and staffing that runs our departments and units.
Northeastern was my destination because it seemed the most innovative university around, a place where we could invent the future of higher education, and that is true! Northeastern has become my home, and I am so happy to be part of this great College and University.
Congratulations! You've done it! - 5/14/2021
My favorite piece of philosophy is the short essay by Albert Camus, The Myth of Sisyphus. Camus looks into the bleakest situations and comes out with a positive view. Sisyphus was condemned to roll a boulder uphill forever, a dismal existence, but Camus understands that the effort Sisyphus makes is the point of his life. At the end he concludes: ‘The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man’s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.’ I have a printed stack of this essay ready to give to anyone whose confidence is down, who is in need of encouragement. It’s encouraging to understand that your effort to achieve is enough (and usually gets you somewhere).
At Northeastern and in the College of Science, we are re-thinking higher education and the university - 5/7/2021
This is graduation week! With exciting in person processions all week on campus, and Commencement in person on Saturday and Sunday at Fenway, how great is this! Again, Northeastern is leading the way, with many universities opting for virtual graduation ceremonies. I am honored to present our College of Science graduates, and my cap, gown and hood are ready. This is a time for CONGRATULATIONS, and my greatest gratitude to each of you who has taught, guided, facilitated and inspired our students. There would be no graduation without you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
The notion of degrees is as old as universities, with the University of Bologna, Italy in continuous operation from the 11th century granting the first degrees. This week I addressed several College graduation celebrations, including the following, generalized for this letter.
You can count on the power of Science - 4/30/2021
We are watching with deepest concern as India is ravaged by COVID-19, and now South American countries are contributing a large percentage of global COVID cases. We extend heartfelt and most sincere hopes for an improved situation to our College of Science faculty, staff and students who have family and friends in India, or in other countries severely affected. We hope that international efforts to send medical supplies and vaccination materials will rapidly assist. Here are some ideas you can consider to help India through this crisis.
Let's make every day Earth Day - 4/23/2021
When I was a student, a requirement for the Zoology major was the Insect Project. You had to collect at least 100 different insects, kill them in a bottle with ethyl acetate, and mount them according to convention using pins and a cork board. I collected 100 exactly, because I did not want to kill more than the minimum, but some of my classmates built elaborate cabinets and presented thousands of different species, some quite rare. Professor Passmore told our class that insects would be the last animal group to survive on earth (after the feared nuclear wars). You can irradiate them and they are untouched, he told us. They will survive anything.
I must have had that notion firmly in my mind, because it was an enormous jolt to learn a few years ago that the insects of our planet were in drastic, devastating decline. There has been a 2.5% decrease in insect mass per year for the last 25-30 years, even in what are considered pristine forests. Extrapolating, within a century there will be none, zero insects. This outcome is thought to result from destroying habitats, especially by agriculture, compounded by pesticide use. Without insects as food, huge numbers of bird, frog, lizard and mammalian species will not survive. Neither will the many predators of the insect eaters. Many flowers will not be pollinated, impacting our food and crops. With this knowledge, last summer, while driving along I-93 towards Vermont, I noticed a butterfly flying on the side of the highway, and realized how daunting to be that small animal, confronted by a wide, busy road with nowhere to alight.
Solving the greatest challenges of our planet - 4/16/2021
We’re surrounded by complex problems, in science, in society and often across science and society. If you’re looking for a definition, ‘complex problems are solvable only through multiple approaches and disciplines’. You know some of the complex problems waiting to be solved – climate change, racism, homelessness, ‘a cure for cancer’. When these problems become political, there is pressure to find a quick fix, but that does not exist, and the absence is construed as failure.
Life’s best moments are about taking small but empowering steps - 4/9/21
Right at the start of the pandemic, last March, when we were truly terrified, and the whole thing seemed a nightmare in which we were stuck, I was walking my now routine loop. Dropped on the sidewalk was a Ziploc bag of green grapes – twelve, taken off their stalks. Some water droplets told me these were carefully washed, perhaps someone was taking them to work, perhaps an essential worker. I walked by, but kept imagining what would happen – over days the grapes would start to rot, and someone would stand on them to make a squishy mess. This bothered me so much that next day I went back. The grapes were untouched, and I opened the bag then tumbled them onto the verge. I took the bag home, washed it and put it in my ready-to-use box. Next day, two of the grapes had disappeared, three the next, then all were gone. I suspected a family of racoons I’d seen crossing the road nearby had been pleased to find the delicious fruit. The whole thing made me feel a bit better, that even in this unbelievably scary moment, one could take a tiny step of useful action.
Hooray for RNA - 4/2/2021
This week I had my first COVID-19 RNA vaccine shot – Pfizer, at a CVS in Belmont. The nurse was top notch and the store employees serious about running an efficient, careful process. The nurse noted that everyone was excited to get their shot (me, too). I was pleased that my arm hurt after, suggesting that my body is responding to viral Spike protein made because of RNA in the vaccine, and starting to produce protective anti-viral antibodies. Back in my thesis days, it would have been hard to imagine hundreds of millions of people being injected with vaccines made of bits of RNA packed in fat droplets. When I was a PhD student, describing the medical applications of RNA in a grant proposal was wishful thinking.
Revising our pandemic brain circuitry - 3/26/21
During the COVID pandemic, we have done a lot of learning. You probably now readily remember to wear a mask when you go outside, and you avoid getting too close to non-pod people without thinking twice. The landscape is quite familiar, because each of us has formed some new neural circuitry. We have also been enormously stressed, and Covid Stress Syndrome is real. Please take care of your mental health, and seek help as you need it.
There is writing now on fear of being normal, post-COVID. Some of this has to do with revising our pandemic brain circuitry and it will be a jolt to try and lose this. I can’t now imagine feeling comfortable going out mask-less. It will help to reactivate pleasant, socializing circuits that have been dormant for a year. We will have to build up again these old pathways, even while remnants of the pandemic persist.
Every person is valued - 3/19/2021
Once more this week, we witnessed horrific violence against Asian people. This morning Associate Dean Randall Hughes and I sent to the entire College a letter (included in our March 5 Update) that reiterates College support for our Asian community, consistent with the message this week from President Aoun. The College of Science is committed to a culture of respect and action towards equity, and is a place where every person is valued, and where each person belongs.
A varied society - 3/5/2021
There has been disturbing news lately about hate crimes against Asian people. I wanted to understand the definition of this term, and found on the US Department of Justice site: “When used in hate crime law, the word ‘hate’ does not mean rage, anger or general dislike. In this context ‘hate’ means bias against people or groups with specific characteristics, and the ‘crime’ is usually a violent one.
After the transition to remote work - 3/12/2021
This is COVID Anniversary Week. One year ago, the World Health Organization acknowledged a worrying new infectious disease, and we locked down to avoid catching and spreading it.
Perseverance Award - 2/26/2021
The Martian lander, Perseverance has a name fitting this past year. It was launched in the depths of the pandemic, July 2020 and made the long trek to Mars, arriving last week. The landing video is so exciting, and I especially like the end where you see the scientists celebrating in the JPL control room. They are women, men and people of varied races, a huge shift from the early uniform demographic of NASA personnel.
The rich ‘connectome’ of our College - 2/19/2021
The still brilliant TV series ‘Connections’ explores how current technologies were shaped by contributions from historical, geographical and societal landscapes, over thousands of years. Host James Burke poses complex questions like ‘how did the touchstone (early money) make square sails obsolete, develop the compass and lead to invention of radar?’ Take a look, the episodes are on YouTube and as surprising as ever. They remind us how discoveries in science often lead in unanticipated, important directions.
A smooth Spring semester - 2/12/2021
We are moving towards Spring! I am sure of this, because even in the frigid weather, the sunlight is staying longer each day, and there is no need for a flashlight on my dog’s afternoon walk. I am sure we are moving towards Spring because there are buds on the rhododendrons and magnolias, magical groups of cells waiting for the moment they can wake up, and make flowers.
Honoring Black scientists - 2/5/2021
This is Black History Month, and a time to affirm our College of Science and Northeastern commitment to anti-racist policies, to a culture of respect, to action against systemic racism and towards equity. We are working hard, and I want to thank every person in the College who is participating in our sincere efforts to meet these goals.
Pandemic Lessons - 1/29/2021
I wrote this a while ago for a story slam, and it seems pertinent to where we are today. “One evening last fall I drove down a hill on Commonwealth Avenue to a striking sunset scene – a flock of birds silhouetted against the bright orange sky. It occurred to me then, that I was going home and the birds were going home, and the bees were at home and the chipmunks.
Happy New Year - 1/22/2021
The morning air has a special sharpness that I love. I think there must be a chemistry involved – an ionization driven by the new light, perhaps? (CCB members, any insight or comment on this 1903 musing?)
Making the Dream Real - 1/15/2021
I was in elementary school when Nobel Laureate, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968. The news crossed the world to South Africa, from where the United States seemed a distant dream. It was a big deal though, because we knew Dr. King’s death was a blow for the Black civil rights movement in the United States.
Gracious Professionalism - 1/8/21
The storming of the Capitol was extraordinary both in that the President encouraged this type of behavior, and in that it was possible to so easily breach security. It was extraordinary, but consistent with our history of white supremacy, that the police were so gentle with the mostly white protesters. We have seen the violence consistently inflicted on Black protesters by police. There is no doubt in my mind that had the storming been carried out by Black people, the outcomes would have been far worse.
For me, these events also highlight that being a good loser is a useful part of life. Losing is a tough and frequent life lesson, that we generally have to politely accept, and try to learn from each instance. Mr. Trump unfortunately, seems not have learned this lesson.
An Extraordinary Effort - 12/18/2020
Speaking of famous Huskies, Balto was a Siberian Husky, a sled dog who is immortalized by a statue in New York’s Central Park. The story is complicated, and a petition indicates that the statue should have depicted another Husky named Togo. But the point is one of hope: an extraordinary effort to bring diptheria antitoxin to Nome, Alaska in 1925, so stopping the outbreak of a terrible illness. Due to a blizzard, planes could not fly and the antitoxin was carried six hundred and seventy-four miles through driving snow and -20oF temperatures by dog sled teams. Balto (or maybe Togo) was the lead dog on the final leg of the dangerous trip.
Jeffrey Agar, PhD
Associate Dean of MS Education and Lifelong Learning
Jeffrey (Jeff) Agar joined the College of Executive Leadership team in 2023 as Associate Dean of MS Education and Lifelong Learning.

Psychology
Food for Thought
The College of Science psychology program works to explore the deepest inner workings of our brains and uncover why we do what we do.
Whatever you do, don’t think about oranges.
Don’t think about their round shape, their bright, textured skin, and their aromatic sweet smell. Just don’t.
So you thought of an orange — and that’s ok. We know it’s hard not to precisely because that’s what our brain is built for: rapidly processing and translating stimuli from our five senses into information, thoughts, and impressions of the world around us. In microseconds, we weigh all of this against what we know, what we think we know, what we feel, and what we have experienced.
Given a certain set of variables, the study of psychology then becomes about understanding and predicting what factors might correspond to thoughts and behavior.
From understanding how a certain customer demographic will respond to commercials, to the ways in which children develop a code of ethics, to yes, even why you thought about oranges after you were told not to, we’re here to help you think about the “why” behind how your brain thinks.
Diversity & Inclusion
The Department of Psychology at Northeastern University is a community of scholars committed to cultivating a culture of inclusion, equity, respect and connectedness. We can develop a more equitable and inclusive psychological science when we encourage a diversity of thought, culture, and viewpoint, which are essential to lifelong learning. Diversity encompasses individuals from any group or identity that has traditionally been marginalized in the academy, in particular in science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) disciplines.
Action Plan:
- Increase the diversity of the department at all levels
- Ensure that every faculty search and graduate student recruitment process maximizes the diversity of the pool of candidates.
- Promote STEM across the entire undergraduate community, including psychology and non-psychology majors.
- Ensure that issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion remain central in all departmental activities.
- Examples: student awards, colloquia/career spotlights, service assignments, communications about diversity education and training events on campus, departmental newsletter.
- Support the inclusion of diverse sources of scholarship in syllabi and coursework, ensuring that a wide diversity of perspectives in psychological science are visible and discussed in all courses.

Marine and Environmental Sciences
Rising to the Occasion
The Northeastern Marine and Environmental Science program seeks to prepare future generations of climatologists, ecologists, and marine biologists for the front lines of climate change — to reclaim our coral reefs, and oceans, our biodiversity, our air, and certainty for our future.
It is in the times marked by great uncertainty that we see the potential of the human spirit. The past trials of war, famine, and disease were equally met by the will of entire generations to overcome. Now, as the reality of climate change sets in, we once again stand at the precipice of a historic and unique challenge, with a call for leadership, foresight, and great courage.
In these times, hope must be prefaced by action. Hard scientific truths will have to be reconciled with economic, political, and social ramifications. It will require a global commitment where every person, no matter their education, age, careers, or affiliations, wear the badge of scientist.
Diversity & Inclusion
The community of faculty, students, and staff at the Northeastern University Department of Marine and Environmental Sciences (MES) and the Marine Science Center (MSC) values diversity and promotes a culture of interdisciplinary collaboration that is responsive to the needs of our multicultural and global society. We believe that diversity, equity, and inclusion are the foundation of effective teaching, learning, and training. Diversity is not only desirable but also required, for advancing our understanding of the environment and arriving at solutions that allow science to more effectively serve humanity

Behavioral Neuroscience
Journey to the Start
The Behavioral Neuroscience program, one of the most established programs in the United States, seeks to trace the connections and uncover the nature of how these mysterious transmissions transform from thoughts into actions.
Einstein once wrote that “The world we have created is a product of our thinking; it cannot be changed without changing our thinking.” Discoveries, innovation, languages, social progress, even entire societies were built on humankind’s actions, as driven by its thoughts.
Yet at its base level, an idea is nothing more than an electro-chemical reaction, with neurons delivering rapid-fire messages across the synapses in our brains. To understand how thought becomes action, we must start where thought begins — within the brain structures and mechanisms themselves.
It is within these physical transmissions that a beautiful and complex mix of communication is taking place. Interpretations, reasoning, and learning are happening here, all at once. And somehow, this cacophony of lightspeed movement harmonizes together to form the endpoint that drives actions and behaviors themselves.

Biochemistry
Making sense out of life
The Northeastern biochemistry program explores how cell structure, chemical bonds and energy transformations impact our understanding of the mechanisms of life and provide a strong foundation for a host of impactful careers in the life sciences.
A person has many trillions of cells in their body and at any given time, there are thousands of biochemical reactions taking place within those cells, even when the body is asleep. There are so many important jobs to be done – you are truly never at rest!
Your heart rate speeds up after you hear a loud noise. Your eyes are able to see what’s around you. Your blood sugar level lets you know whether you should break down that fuel and use it now, or whether you should store it in your muscles for later. How do these signals have meaning inside of us? Biochemists study these reactions and many more.
Understanding biochemical processes is a crucial step in problem-solving some of the world’s greatest challenges – disease, hunger, pollution. The success of vaccines to mitigate illnesses like smallpox, influenza, and coronavirus are examples that show how important it is to have a deep understanding of how diseases work and how they can be targeted.

PlusOne Degrees and Accelerated PhD Programs
The PlusOne program allows current Northeastern students the opportunity to pursue both a bachelor’s and master’s degree successively in a condensed period of time. We also offer Accelerated PhD programs in Biology and Physics.
Overview
For students pursuing a PlusOne degree, several credits of undergraduate work are replaced by graduate coursework, thus permitting the completion of an undergraduate degree, as well as a full master’s degree, in a shorter period of time than would be possible if students pursued each degree separately through the traditional route.
In most programs, with appropriate academic progress, students receive the master’s degree one year after completing the undergraduate degree.
To apply to the PlusOne Master’s degree or Accelerated PhD program you must be a current Northeastern undergraduate student. Interested students should see the requirements below for more information before applying. Students should apply to enter the PlusOne program no earlier than their fifth academic semester and at least two academic semesters before expecting to earn the Bachelor of Science degree (three academic semesters prior for Marine Biology). Eligible candidates will complete an online application. No GRE or application fee is required!
Note: Any financial aid a student may have received from the university while an undergraduate will not continue once the student obtains graduate status. PlusOne students are not eligible for the Double Husky Scholarship.

Accelerated PhD Programs
BS Physics
To participate in the program, students must be on spring co-op (Div BA) or skip their last co-op, and must have a 3.5 GPA in their physics courses for accelerated entry into the program. Students can participate by successfully completing the degree requirements, including successful completion of two 7000-level physics graduate courses and one shared 5000 level course before receiving their BS degree (PHYS7321, PHYS7301 and PHYS 5318). All students must email the Graduate Director by April 1 before the start of their final undergrad year for permission to take 7000 level courses to enter the first stage of the BS/PhD program. Acceptance into this stage will allow students to take the 7000 level courses required for entry to the program, but this does not guarantee admission to graduate portion of the program. Students would then apply formally to the graduate program by December 1 of year 4 (or year 5 for undergraduate students opting for a 5-year BS track), and receive their BS at the end of year 4 (or year 5 for undergraduate students opting for a 5-year BS track).
BS/PhD students will apply to the Physics PhD program by December 1 in the final year of their BS degree. If students meet the grade and course requirements, we will require only standard application materials such as a personal statement, two letters of recommendation, and transcript. These limited application requirements are defined as accelerated admission and contingent upon successful completion of the 2 – 7000 level courses and 1 – 5000 level course. Students must have a grade of B or higher in all three courses to apply for accelerated admission.
Students interested in pursuing the Accelerated PhD in Physics should first contact the Graduate Director, Paul Whitford to express interest and find out more about the program.

These mentors will meet regularly with the Fellow to assist with the development of the Fellow’s independent research program.
The COS Associate Dean for Research will introduce the Fellow to key Research Development staff and resources at Northeastern, and provide support for the development of research proposals. The Fellow will be encouraged to participate in the Postdoctoral Scientist career development, leadership training, and social programming offered through the College of Science, the PhD Network, CATLR, and ADVANCE.
Resources
Lab and office space and a research allowance will be provided. Fellows will have access to shared equipment, and state-of-the-art Centers and Facilities at Northeastern, and in the Boston area.
Outcomes
Fellows will build an independent research program and work to develop independent research funding. The expectation is that the Science Fellows will transition to a tenure-track faculty position following the Postdoctoral period.

Physics
Everything (In Theory)
Why can’t light escape a black hole? What exactly is dark matter? Why is the gravitational force so weak? In physics, we know everything is bound by the same rules and happens for a reason. It’s the “why” of every action and reaction that keeps us curious.
The College of Science physics program equips you with what we know about our universe — theories on matter, the forces, space, and time — so you can reach into the unknown and answer the question… why?
Diversity & Inclusion
The College of Science supports a culture where each person feels they belong, regardless of race, color, religion, religious creed, genetic information, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, national origin, ancestry, veteran or disability status. We celebrate the diversity of our community, and we seek to expand representation to further excellence. We commit to be a College where members act with respect, trust, collaboration, and communication, and where inappropriate behavior is reported and acted on without fear of retaliation.

Experimental particle physics research involves exploring unknown questions about nature on the smallest scales: What constitutes dark matter? Why is the Higgs boson so light? What produced the imbalance between matter and antimatter that we observe today? Are there extra dimensions? Are there new particles or fundamental interactions that are yet to be discovered? Our group in experimental particle physics works on the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. We study precision measurements of Standard Model processes and search for signatures of new physics, such as leptoquarks, dark matter candidates, and exotic production and decays of Higgs bosons. In parallel we have a broad involvement in the operation of the CMS detector and development of new detector systems for the High Luminosity LHC upgrade.

Center for Coatings Research
The Center for Coatings Research (CCR) has continued to make progress towards the development of low thermal noise coatings that will enable the next generation of gravitational wave detectors in the US, Cosmic Explorer (CE).
The CCR combines efforts from nine US institutions, integrating coating deposition, characterization of atomic structure and macroscopic material properties, and computational modeling. This interdisciplinary approach has led to significant advancements in understanding the structural motifs associated with mechanical loss. Building on this knowledge, the CCR has focused on further developing Ti:GeO2 and studying other amorphous materials to meet CE requirements, as well as continuing the development of crystalline AlGaAs coatings by studying small-scale samples and scalability to large-diameter optics.
Additionally, the CCR has fostered a strong collaborative environment through workshops, meetings, and coordinated research efforts. In partnership with the LSC Optics Working Group, the CCR hosted two coatings workshops over the past year attached to each LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA meeting, as well as participating in the biweekly OWG Zoom meetings and holding monthly CCR PI telecons.
The strength of the CCR and its promise of accelerating the R&D of low-loss coatings arise from the effective integration of our nine groups, in collaboration with the LSC and CE-Consortium.

EFRC: Molecular magnetic quantum materials
The Center for Molecular Magnetic Quantum Materials (M2QM) provides a unique integration of advanced theory, innovative experiment, and expert chemical synthesis to design, probe, and control the quantum degrees of freedom of electron spins at the scale of molecules. Molecular spins, also known as molecular magnets, offer the potential of almost limitless tunability via the techniques of coordination chemistry, with respect to coherence, energy gaps, and cou-plings. Furthermore, molecular qubits are completely identical and easy to create in large numbers. However, there remain many challenges for realizing quantum information (and oth-er quantum) applications with molecules in practice, for example, related to their control, ad-dressing, and integration into technologies at larger scales. The Center brings together experts in the synthesis of molecular magnets, characterization with unique spectroscopies, technolog-ical integration via surface and macromolecular chemistries, and computational modeling of quantum properties, to carry out fundamental research to identify new and promising molecu-lar platforms in which to advance along the specific challenges above.

A Computational Approach to Study the Structural Ensembles of Genes
Genomes fold into distinct architectures that reflect both the cell's phase and type, with the spatial organization of genes playing a crucial role in facilitating physical interactions among genetic regulatory elements. These interactions are essential for gene regulation within organisms and tissues. This project aims to develop innovative theoretical and computational tools to model the mechanics of chromatin at the gene level, enabling the study of how various genetic factors influence the three-dimensional structure of genes.

From Searchlights to Floodlights: Expanding the Scope and Impact of Criminal Municipal Court Data
Criminal municipal courts in the US are standalone courts that operate under the purview of municipalities and cities, as opposed to state judiciaries. They are largely thought to be the “lowest” tier of the criminal legal system, usually processing misdemeanors or local ordinance violations. They are also relatively under-studied as an institution and often operate in ways that perpetuate unequal or biased outcomes. The general public has little sense of the volume of cases being tried in the system, the amount of money collected by municipalities through fines and fees, and even the number of courts in a given state. In this grant, we take a system-wide approach in collecting, digitizing, and visualizing longitudinal data on every criminal municipal court in every state where they operate. In addition to analyzing, visualizing, and summarizing this massive dataset, we will produce a suite of policy recommendations designed to improve a system that too often contributes to injustice in our criminal legal system.

NSF-BSF: Molecular and biophysical mechanisms underlying contractile valve assembly and function
Many of the organs in our body are built of tubes. They include the digestive, reproductive, and cardiovascular systems. Critical components of these tubular systems are contractile valves and sphincters that regulate passage of solid or liquid contents between tissue compartments. Sphincters in large tissues are made of many muscle cells arranged in a circle. However, tiny valves composed of a just few cells can somehow also perform these functions. In the reproductive system of the nematode C. elegans there is a donut-shaped valve that opens and closes hundreds of times to allow eggs to pass from where they are fertilized to the uterus. The team, which includes investigators at Northeastern, Tel Aviv University, and the Technion, will characterize the inner structure of the valve cell with light and electron microscopy and use genetic perturbations to discover the molecular mechanisms that regulate its formation. Then, they will investigate its function with live imaging and use biophysical modeling to understand how its structure underlies its function.

Coming of age in a digital world
The pervasive use of smartphones for social interaction has changed the landscape of adolescent social life in ways that have not been adequately characterized. Despite this rapid rise in digital social activity (DSA; calls, messaging, and social media app usage), it remains unclear how this dramatic shift has impacted adolescent development and wellbeing. Previous work in this area has been limited by overly general measures that treat DSA as a single construct (e.g., total screentime), inaccurate self-report estimates, cross-sectional studies that cannot speak to dynamic relationships over time, and limited attention to mechanistic markers of risk and resilience. This proposal leverages real-time digital phenotyping data and machine learning approaches to characterize how DSA and the developing self-concept interact to shape adolescent resilience and wellbeing. 80 adolescents aged 12-17y will participate in an intensive longitudinal design, providing 8 months of rich multi-modal data that includes: continuous passive collection of DSA via smartphone, ecological momentary assessments (i.e., brief surveys on the smartphone) of wellbeing and virtue embodiment (e.g., gratitude, optimism, curiosity, compassion), monthly measures of wellbeing and virtue embodiment, and experimental task behavior to extract biases in social threat processing. Identifying factors conferring risk or resilience at a fine-grained level of temporal specificity has potential to inform individually-targeted and scalable interventions. Thus, we include a pilot intervention study that will leverage real-time data and machine learning to enhance resilience via character virtue embodiment using individually tailored (i.e., idiographic) nudges to smartphones providing the right type of prompt at the right time. The proposed study is poised to significantly advance the field by using innovative methods to characterize how teens shape and are shaped by the digital age of socialization.

The many-body problem in the age of quantum machine learning
The study of exotic phases of matter of quantum origin is one of the cornerstones of modern condensed matter physics, motivating a quest for materials and models that could exhibit novel unconventional properties that can find application beyond the semiconductor paradigm. However, understanding correlated quantum systems requires dealing with a large configuration space: datasets are comprised of all possible electronic configurations and cannot be stored in the memory of the largest supercomputer. Hence, the many-body problem can be interpreted as an “extreme data science'' problem from an information processing perspective. Since the advent of high-temperature superconductivity, progress has been marked by ingenuity to overcome the computational limitations imposed by hardware. A game-changing idea consists of identifying patterns and compressing datasets in a spirit very similar to algorithms to compress images and videos. Since 2018, we have witnessed the emergence of a novel line of research now referred-to as “quantum machine learning” that uses neural networks and machine-learning algorithms to extract insightful information and represent the complex entanglement structure encoded in quantum wave-functions.

Cognitive Foundations of Environmental Science Education: Exploring Impacts of Human Exceptionalism on Marine Social-Ecological Systems Thinking
Environmental issues are among the most pressing facing humankind. As such, understanding how students learn about environmental science is of supreme importance. Students entering the science classroom bring well-developed intuitive frameworks that help to understand, explain, and predict the world around them. While these frameworks can be beneficial for navigating a complex world, they may also create obstacles in environmental science education. This project will explore the impacts of a powerful intuitive conceptual framework – human exceptionalism (HE), the belief that humans are separate from the natural world – upon an increasingly dominant paradigm in environmental science – social-ecological systems (SES), which acknowledges that human social systems are part of natural ecosystems. This project is an interdisciplinary collaboration between cognitive and environmental scientists focused on enhancing our understanding of STEM learning and learning environments by investigating the conceptual structures underlying acquisition of expertise in environmental science, further elaborating a theoretical framework on the cognitive underpinnings of science learning and teaching, and informing pedagogical best practices in the environmental sciences and related fields.

A Plant Small-Molecule Discovery Platform to Study Neurodegeneration (CP2-Weng)
The proposed research aims to develop a plant-based drug screening platform to identify small molecules that can disrupt protein and RNA aggregation associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's. The project will utilize the unique lyciumin peptide biosynthesis pathway in plants to generate a diverse library of cyclic peptides. These peptides will be screened in engineered tobacco BY-2 cells expressing aggregation-prone proteins (e.g., huntingtin) and RNAs (e.g., CAG repeats) to identify compounds that alleviate cellular toxicity and alter aggregation kinetics. Lead compounds will be further evaluated in mammalian cell models to assess their efficacy and mechanism of action. The established screening platform and identified compounds will be made available to the research community, potentially offering new tools and therapeutic strategies for studying and treating neurodegenerative disorders.

Elucidating the mechanisms that enable translation in bacterial and eukaryotic ribosomes
This award will use theoretical models and high-performance computing to study the ribosome, a massive molecular assembly composed of hundreds of thousands of atoms. The ribosome is responsible for translating our genes into proteins, making its function central to all life. In this study, we will identify the molecular factors that control protein synthesis in bacteria and higher-level organisms. Insights into bacteria will aim to identify novel antibiotics, while the study of human ribosomes can shed light on a range of diseases, including metabolic diseases and forms of cancer.

Targeting SHP-1 through a newfound metabolite-regulated cysteine activation site
This new project is focused on chemical manipulation and characterization of SHP-1 based on recent insights, gained in large part from the development of mass spectrometry approaches to map small molecule covalent interactions proteome-wide done in the Chouchani laboratory. My research group will apply hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry (MS) to investigate conformational changes of SHP-1 upon binding to itaconate and itaconate- mimetics to ascertain if SHP-1 activation leads to conformational rearrangement and then determine where those rearrangements take place within SHP-1. These HDX MS studies will provide solution-based measurements that will complement the X-ray crystallography studies of the same system.

Direct RNA sequencing using electro-optical zero mode waveguides and custom click fluorescent nucleotides
Reading the sequence and detecting the diversity of chemical modifications in RNA molecules would be a huge step forward for understanding the biology and disease-causing events in human cells. However, methods that can directly read single molecules are lacking, prompting us to develop an ultra-sensitive technology that directly reads RNA molecules, one at a time, at low-cost and with high throughput. Our method will an array of nanometer scale devices in which individual enzymes replicate RNA and report on the RNA sequence and presence of modifications, all from minute amounts that are equivalent to the number of RNA molecules in a single human cell.

Annual Environmental and Social Responsibility Grant: Ocean Genome Legacy Student Research in DNA Preservation
This grant will support OGL's long running and successful Student Research in DNA Preservation Program, providing funds for experiments to improve the quality of DNA extracted from frozen biological materials. Freezing at ultra-cold temperatures (>80°C) is considered the "gold standard" for preserving DNA in tissue samples. However, OGL's co-op student researchers noticed that DNA extracted from frozen tissue often appears highly degraded. OGL students hypothesized that this may be due to tissue thawing, which is required during DNA extraction. Even if this thawing lasts just a few seconds, there might be enough time for DNase enzymes to break the DNA down. To prevent this damage, OGL students are testing what happens if frozen tissue is thawed overnight in chilled liquid preservatives instead of extracting DNA directly from frozen tissue. If successful, this could save millions of frozen samples in collections worldwide that might otherwise not be useful for genomic research.

Breaking prolonged sitting with high intensity interval training to improve cognitive and brain health in older adults
Capitalizing on Physical Activity intensity as the major limiting factor in peripheral catecholamine increase, we propose a randomized crossover trial to compare 2 conditions lasting 3.5 h each: sitting interrupted by 6-min HIIT every 30 min (HIIT Breaks), and sitting interrupted by 6-min social interactions (SIT) to address 3 aims: (i) to assess feasibility, acceptability, fidelity, and safety of HIIT Breaks to improve neurocognitive function; (ii) to quantify the differences between conditions in the change in P3b amplitude and latency; (iii) to explore the differences between conditions in attentional control, episodic memory, and functional connectivity (FC) of the frontoparietal and default mode networks. Our long-term objective is to test the chronic effects of HIIT breaks on the integrity of the locus coeruleus, frontoparietal function, and cognitive functions affected by aging and AD in cognitively healthy and cognitively impaired seniors.

Center for Complex Particle Systems (Compass)
Robustness under variable conditions is an essential property that biological organisms and human networks acquire by adopting a dynamic hierarchical structure. Moreover, complex organization spontaneously emerges from simple constitutents if they are numerous, strongly interacting and diverse. A nearly identical set of attributes is characteristic of colloidal particles, ranging in size from nanometers to microns. The Center for Complex Particle Systems (COMPASS) will understand, develop, and exploit this paradigm in systems of strongly interacting and polydisperse colloidal particles. In doing so, we expect to fundamentally transform the discipline of colloidal science and to engender transformative changes in multiple areas of engineering and particle-based manufacturing.

Discovery and engineering of plant branched cyclic peptide biosynthesis
Plants offer an enormous chemodiversity that is essential for discovering new medicines, with 25% of all FDA-approved drugs coming from plants. However, the production of plant-derived natural products faces significant challenges. Our research aims to explore the biosynthesis and bioengineering of lyciumins and moroidins, two classes of branched cyclic peptides with potential pharmaceutical applications. Lyciumins, inhibitors of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme, come from the Goji berry, while moroidins, derived from the Australian stinging tree, exhibit anti-mitotic activities suitable for cancer therapy. Both are ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) in plants, suggesting potential for enhanced chemical diversity and production. We propose to advance our understanding of RiPP diversity and biosynthesis, supporting new strategies for their engineering and application in medicine.

Reconsidering context: Theory and Measurement
Self-reports of experience are most often quantified via anchored, Likert-type rating scales (e.g., using a scale from 0-5, where 0 is no fatigue and 5 is maximal fatigue). Raters change how they use such scales when their internal bodily state changes, making such scales poorly reliable and invalid under such conditions. The investigators have developed a new normalized self-report rating scale method in which people map specific prior autobiographical experiences to person-specific scale metrics. The researchers will compare metrics from the new scales to traditional Likert-type metrics. They also will use a well-known (and safe) immune challenge, a typhoid vaccine, to assess whether the new scale method provides more reliable and valid self-report outcomes across different bodily states. A new method is important for testing new drug or behavioral treatments when pre- and post-treatment ratings of experience (like fatigue) are used to determine whether a new treatment is effective.

Framework for Converting Gate-Based Quantum Computing Models to Quantum Annealing Models for Large-Scale Electronic Structure and Dynamics Simulations
Simulating the electronic structure of molecular systems using noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices is one of the most promising applications of quantum computing. Large-scale electronic structure and dynamics simulations, such as excited-state simulations of large molecules or a large number of molecules, are instrumental to the development of next-generation technology for energy applications. In this project, we will develop a framework that efficiently translates quantum algorithms from a gate-based quantum computing model to one that can be efficiently run on a near-term quantum annealer to enable large-scale electronic structure theory simulations across different quantum computing architectures. These algorithms will offer an adaptive approach to predicting both the ground and excited electronic states of molecules, which has direct applications in simulating the photodynamics of macromolecules and materials related to but not limited to solar energy harvesting and conversions.

Modeling the mucosal glycopeptide mesh for improved disease understanding and mucin-inspired biomaterial design
Mucins and other densely glycosylated proteins play critical roles in a number of biological processes, disease conditions, and therapeutics. The functioning of these sugar-coated molecular machines depends on their structure, dynamics, and conformational transitions. Experimental techniques for capturing such structural dynamics, however, can be extremely challenging and resource intensive. We seek to improve upon some of the existing glycan modeling computational tools as well as design new in silico techniques, as robust alternatives to experimental studies. These tools will be used to build interconnected mucin glycoprotein gel systems with native glycosylation patterns, and obtain understanding of functional underpinnings at the molecular level.

mCDR 2023: Developing a coupled benthic-pelagic biogeochemical model to evaluate the effectiveness of mCDR interventions
Deep cuts to emissions across all sectors are needed in order to limit global warming to 1.5˚C to 2˚C above preindustrial values. If zero emission is ever to be achieved, further implementation of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategies are also necessary to offset emissions from hard-to- abate sources. This project will focus on two CDR approaches with direct influence on the ocean sediment: seaweed farming and further sinking into the deep ocean and restoration of “blue carbon” coastal ecosystem, more specifically cessation of bottom trawling to preserve sediment carbon. We will do so by developing a new model for the ocean sediment and benthos that can be coupled to existing ocean models to simulate these strategies and quantify their effect on the carbon cycle as well as understand potential feedbacks that could impact the ocean ecosystem.

Understanding Mediating and Moderating Factors that Determine Transfer of Working Memory Training
This proposal aims to improve the rigor and reproducibility of research on plasticity in human working memory (WM), and related executive functions (EFs) in adolescent youth. We address a critical gap between research and practice that is characterized by a growing commercial space marketing cognitive training approaches (with WM being one of the most common targets), which are particularly catering to typically developing children and those diagnosed with ADHD to improve mental health and scholastic performance. However, despite expansive literature, there exists limited basic research on WM and EF training in adolescents, and both methods and findings are mixed across studies. Here, we address these significant gaps that pose obstacles to understanding interventions’ reliability and validity by collecting a large-scale open dataset that compares different training approaches on a common set of outcome measures.

Integrative biophysical modeling for collective tissue mechanics
Organ surfaces, made of epithelial or endothelial cells, serve as physical barriers. These cells are generally static but can transition to a dynamic, migratory state during physiological processes like development and repair. Traditional studies focus on these cells in 2D flat surfaces, which doesn't translate well to natural epithelia that often have curved geometries and varied topologies like spheres and tubes. Key questions remain about how curvature affects cell collective movement and the mechanics of multilayered tissues like mammalian epidermis. These issues are particularly critical during epidermal development, where cues and timescale-dependent mechanics are not well understood. To address these gaps, I plan to develop computational models that go beyond the conventional 2D approach, incorporating curved and multilayered 3D surfaces. This will include new models exploring the biomechanical relationship between nuclear shapes and cell proliferation.

Behavioral and neurocognitive mechanisms linking peer victimization to adolescent psychopathology
Adolescence is a period of heightened vulnerability for many forms of psychopathology. This vulnerability comes at a time when emotional and physiological responses to peer rejection are elevated, rendering peer victimization particularly damaging. Despite the strong links between peer victimization and internalizing problems during adolescence, the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. The proposed project will test a novel conceptual model, whereby two underlying dimensions of peer victimization, peer threat (e.g., presence of negative social experiences, like rejection) and peer deprivation (e.g., absence of positive social experiences, like ostracism) differentially shape neurocognitive processes and social behaviors that have relevance for psychopathology. We test this conceptual model using experimental and observational approaches in an intensive longitudinal design, including experimental and fMRI tasks, digital phenotyping, and predictive modeling approaches. This work is a necessary first step in developing targeted interventions to mitigate the effects of peer victimization during adolescence.

Empirical Power Analysis Tool for fMRI
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research has transformed our understanding of human brain function and disease, but recent work has exposed an endemic lack of statistical power (i.e., ability to detect effects of interest) and a need for power analysis tools that meet the demands of the typical user. We propose to create a web-based power calculator tailored to typical fMRI studies that only requires the user to specify information readily available to them. By enabling researchers to more easily and accurately plan studies for desired levels of power, this power calculator will promote more robust and reproducible findings in the field.

DMS/NIGMS 2: Regulation of Cellular Stemness during the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)
We propose a joint theoretical/experimental research program to address cell-fate trajectories that occur during induction of EMT, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Specifically. recent efforts have indicated that epithelial cells can either undergo direct reprogramming to mesenchymal states or alternatively become more stem-like and exhibit hybrid E/M properties. Based on our preliminary investigations, we will use state-of-the-art single cell measurement technology together with advanced mathematical modelling frameworks to understand how cells choose specific fates and to quantitatively unravel the genetic and epigenetic dynamics that leads these cells along their particular trajectories. We will develop new mathematical concepts such as the role of frustration in cell fate networks, the effects of global competition on epigenetic interactions, the role of confluency in governing cell-cell interactions, and the introduction of model-based ideas into trajectory inference, as part of our investigation.

A Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Framework for Attentional Control Traits and States
In this collaborative project that involves groups from Washington University (St. Louis), Brown University, University of California, Irvine, as well as several groups in Australia, we develop tools / apps to assess attention control in high-performing adults (e.g. pilots or air-traffic controllers) using computational modeling as well as behavioral and neuroimaging methods. Furthermore, we build evidence-based interventions to maximize and improve attention control functions in various environments (e.g. stressful environments, those that require long and sustained attention, etc.). The outcome of our project will provide a better understanding of the human attention system, and the interventions will enable individuals to maintain high levels of focus and concentration even in high-pressure situations, such as those faced by military personnel. This grant / project would be an excellent showcase to highlight our new center, the Brain Game Center for Mental Fitness and Well-Being, and thus, we'd love to be contacted with the COS Marketing and Communications team to talk about our ongoing and future work!

Transcendental fiber functors, shift of argument algebras and Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for q-difference equations
This project stems from the recent discovery that quantum groups naturally arise from the Stokes data of differential equations associated to classical symmetries. The main goals are to further explore this bridge between classical and quantum symmetries. Of particular interest is the extension to difference equations, which are natural discretisations of differential equations, and whose Stokes data are not well-understood beyond the one-variable case. Another important direction will the study of the integrable systems, or constants of motion, corresponding to these differential and difference equations. The project will provide research training opportunities for graduate students.

Activation of Benzoxaborole Prodrug AN15368, a Clinical Candidate for Chagas Disease
Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is endemic in the Americas, but has also globalized due to human migration. Despite being one of the major causes of infection-induced heart disease worldwide, current therapies for Chagas disease have inconsistent efficacy and frequent side effects. A major contributor to treatment failure is thought to be the transiently dormant intracellular forms of T. cruzi that are resistant to otherwise highly effective trypanocidal compounds. The newly discovered benzoxaborole AN15368 represents the first extensively validated and safe clinical candidate for the treatment of Chagas disease. AN15368 acts as a prodrug that requires cleavage by parasite serine carboxypeptidases (TcCBPs) to yield the active metabolite. This proposal aims to gain additional understanding of this processing step for AN15368 as a prodrug, as well as to assess the potential for acquired resistance as this compound proceeds toward human clinical trials.

Categorical centers, cactus actions, and diagram algebras
This project delves into several research directions within representation theory, which is the mathematical framework for studying objects through their symmetries and the operations which preserve them. Such operations can carry a classical, or even more intriguingly a quantum algebraic structure. Originally appearing in physical models within statistical mechanics and quantum integrable systems, quantum groups and the theory surrounding them are now a thriving source of uncovering new mathematical principles. This project will develop a richer understanding of this theory by building a common ground for combining algebraic, combinatorial, and higher-structural categorical techniques for the study of quantum groups and associated diagram algebras. This will lead to a more unified approach and provide connections between several areas of mathematics, as well as potential physical applications. The project will involve the participation of undergraduate students and create opportunities for discussion and collaboration among early-career researchers.

The influence of biophysical coupling and cross-scale interactions on ecosystems of the Plum Island LTER |
Understanding salt marsh ecosystems is crucial because marsh plants create unique and productive wetland habitat in temperate estuaries for a variety of economically valuable and ecologically important fishes, birds, and invertebrates. In addition to creating habitat, salt marshes provide key ecosystem services by removing excess nutrients from terrestrial run-off, buffering shorelines from storm erosion, and sequestering atmospheric carbon. In the Merrimack River-Plum Island estuarine system just north of Boston, some salt marshes can receive copious amounts of allochthonous inputs in the form of marsh plant detritus (i.e., large mats of “wrack”), while other salt marshes do not. This project will use aerial imagery, drones, and AI to quantify whether wrack accumulates into hierarchically organized hot spots according to predictions based on the oceanography of the system. Outdoor field and laboratory experiments will then be conducted to determine whether the oceanographically-generated landscape patterns of wrack set the pace for food web dynamics in this critical ecosystem. This project is funded by the National Science Foundation. |

This project aims to uncover the genetic mechanisms that underlie antibiotic treatment failure in hospital-acquired bacterial infections. We will analyze "enabler" mutations and phenotypes that promote antibiotic tolerance and act as stepping stones for the development of antibiotic resistance and treatment failure. A major focus is the pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii, which causes hospital-acquired diseases including pneumonia and sepsis that have become increasingly difficult to treat. |

Role of Mitochondria as Intracellular Shuttles for Nuclear Gene-regulatory Transcription Factors During Pluripotent Cell Division and Fate Specification |
This project combines our technological advancements in mitochondrial analysis and nanosorting with an in-vivo mitochondrial lineage tracing approach, which will enable us able to map the developmental fate of specific mitochondrial subtypes in mammalian eggs through post-fertilization to the point in early embryogenesis when the inner cell mass and trophectoderm are specified at the first cell-fate decision. This project will also explore the novel concept that subtypes of mitochondria, which differ in their biochemical properties, proteomic landscapes, and segregation patterns during asymmetric cell divisions, serve as transcription factor shuttles that then guide stem cell fate decisions and lineage commitment during development |

Combination Intraperitoneal Local Delivery of PARPi Implants and Anti-PDL1 |
Aggressive metastatic ovarian cancer patients have limited therapy options and clinical trials to evaluate promising alternative combinations have been limited due to the high toxicity. Here we propose a bio/nanoformulation approach to delivery PARPi directly into the peritoneal cavity for sustained release and limited toxicity in combination with innate and adaptive immune modulating nanoparticles of ADU-S100 and anti-PDL1. |

Collaborative Research: Mapping and comparing the link of the protein scaffold to quantum events in thermally activated enzymes and flavin‐based photoreceptors. |
This work will enhance understanding of how biology integrates quantum behavior into macromolecular function. Proteins and macromolecules have evolved to rely, at least to some degree, on underlying quantum phenomena such as tunneling and spin coherence. The biological outcomes depend on the interplay between the scaffold of the protein (which is often treated classically) and the quantum behavior found within more localized regions of the protein. Investigators within this collaboration will draw upon both experimental and theoretical efforts that focus on hydrogen tunneling and vibrational energy transport in lipoxygenase catalysis as well as on optically excited radical pair formation, spin coherence, and decay in proteins (cryptochromes) that are associated with magnetoreception and circadian clocks. |

Soft wearables with high energy density: merging chemical biology and silicone chemistry with compliant active devices (WeArAble) |
The purpose of this grant is to develop soft, wearable actuators with enhanced power output compared to the state of the art by combining cutting edge synthetic and biosynthetic materials. Existing wearable actuators either require bulky power sources and rigid "exoskeletons" to be effective, or are limited in their utility by low power outputs. The grant represents a collaboration between Northeastern, Technical University of Denmark, and EPFL (Switzerland). The Joshi lab at Northeastern will focus on developing protein fiber materials from engineered bacteria with optimal mechanical and electrostatic performance. |

Targeting adolescent depression symptoms using network-based real-time fMRI neurofeedback and mindfulness meditation
Adolescents experience alarmingly high rates of major depressive disorder (MDD), and these episodes are highly recurrent and increase suicide risk. Recently, the U.S. Surgeon General and leading pediatric health organizations declared a national state of emergency for adolescent mental health, underscoring that the majority of affected adolescents do not receive adequate treatment. As gold-standard depression treatments (antidepressant medications and cognitive behavioral therapy) are effective for only ~50% of adolescents, there is a critical need to develop novel treatments to improve clinical outcomes, particularly those that target core mechanisms fundamental to MDD. Rumination (i.e., repetitive, negative patterns of thinking typically focused on the self) contributes to MDD onset, maintenance, and recurrence as well as predicts treatment non-response and relapse. Mindfulness meditation has been shown to suppress the default mode network (DMN), a set of brain regions that are overactive in depression and that underlie rumination. We are launching a large scale, clinical trial to do a mindfulness based real-time fMRI neurofeedback intervention in adolescents with MDD in order to quiet the DMN and mitigate rumination.

Time-locked psychophysics: speeded responses to visual stimuli
The project will use variations on a classic method called response time (RT) measurement, which has human participants respond as quickly as possible to the presentation of carefully-controlled visual patterns. One goal is to demonstrate that the fastest RTs are triggered by the very early responses in the photoreceptors of the retina of the eye. Two parallel pathways in the visual system called ON and OFF pathways, generate opposite-polarity responses. A second goal is to test the hypothesis that these two pathways can be measured and studied separately using these speeded behavioral responses

CAREER: Sedimentary signatures of large riverine floods to constrain risk and build resiliency
The traditional paradigm in river and floodplain management relies almost exclusively on stream gage measurements as the key dataset informing flood hazard assessments, while largely neglecting the geomorphic dynamics and resulting sedimentary records preserved in floodplains. This project builds on prior work in the development and application of stratigraphic records in floodplains by harnessing recent advances in hydraulic modeling, environmental sensors, and sedimentology to constrain flood hazard assessments. This research is integrated with an education and outreach plan designed to attract, motivate, and train community college students in geoscience research through an established internship program.

Disease-homing light delivery by engineering bioluminescent immune cells for whole body precision photomedicine
Photomedicine avoids traditional side effects of systemic chemotherapy, yet effective outcomes are dependent on direct irradiation from an external light source that limits the scope and the types of cancers that may be treated. This proposal develops a precision photomedicine platform that exploits natural disease-homing properties of the immune system to mediate bioluminescence-activated phototherapy in combination with established technology to deliver photoactive therapeutic agents selectively to tumor cells. Successful, proof-of-concept studies will establish a new paradigm of systemic, whole-body phototherapy by enabling immune cell-based light delivery to deep and diffuse metastatic disease that would otherwise be impractical to treat using an external light source, thereby overcoming a major limitation of conventional phototherapy.

The goals of this award are first to design and validate a scalable, affordable hardware-software package that reliably measures brain function via EEG in babies over the first two years of life. Second, in multi-country studies using this EEG system, we will establish which measures of early brain function track healthy developmental changes associated with early cognitive and language development across contexts and are sensitive to pre- and postnatal risk factors for brain development. Finally, we will establish which EEG measures of brain function are robust enough to serve as biomarkers to evaluate clinical intervention trial efficacy in early life.

Riverine flooding is a perennial hazard in the heavily populated Northeastern United States, and improving near- and long-term forecasts of flooding in this region is of critical importance for regional water resource management, infrastructure planning, and fisheries. In this project, we will harness advances in climate reanalysis and modeling to (i) identify the ocean-atmosphere patterns that generate flooding in New England and (ii) evaluate the contribution of greenhouse forcing on flood-generating mechanisms in this region.

Auditory hallucinations are one of the five cardinal symptoms of schizophrenia and one of the most distressing. Almost a third of patients experiencing auditory hallucinations are not responsive to gold-standard pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment. We have pioneered a new non-invasive treatment candidate, computational neuroscience-based approach, also known as network-based real-time functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) Neurofeedback that is a well-tolerated and effective approach for reducing the severity and frequency of auditory hallucinations. However, because this technique currently requires fMRI to deliver neurofeedback, which unfortunately is an expensive procedure involving a complex setup and participant burden, this NIH award will help develop novel, non-invasive, personalized, and scalable treatments that will improve outcomes and reduce relapse rates among schizophrenia patients with treatment resistant auditory hallucinations.

Salt marshes provide an important line of defense against nutrient pollution by intercepting watershed nitrogen before it enters estuaries. This nitrogen can enhance the growth of marsh plants, however some forms of nitrogen can also be used by microbes, who use it to decompose organic matter in low-oxygen sediments. Understanding which of these two outcomes is most likely to occur is important because, if marsh plants take up that nitrogen and grow more robustly, this will increase salt marsh resilience to sea-level rise. On the other hand, if microbes use that nitrogen for respiration, it could accelerate loss of organic matter, thereby decreasing resilience. This project combines field and greenhouse experiments to tease apart the relative importance of different N forms on the plant and microbial communities that ultimately dictate salt marsh resilience.

Addressing collective action problems such as climate change requires individuals to engage in a host of coordinated behaviors to effect widespread systemic changes. Yet, while most people are concerned about climate change, they systematically underestimate others’ concern, which can inhibit action toward addressing collective challenges. Drawing on interdisciplinary research, this project uses mixed methods to develop and test an integrative framework illuminating drivers of pervasive social misperceptions and pathways for correcting these biases.

Healthy debate is a cornerstone of scientific progress, but no one really knows when, how, and why these debates in science happen. In our funded research, we will use new computational techniques to automatically identify debates across the entire published scientific literature. We will study these debates to understand the role of disagreement in science and find policies that harness the power of debate to increase the pace of scientific discovery.

The degradation and transport of plastics has led to its accumulation across a range of environments, but a key component of the plastic-carbon cycle — namely the transport and storage of microplastics through rivers and floodplains — remains poorly constrained. Understanding where and why plastics accumulate along rivers and floodplains is critical for mitigating and managing plastic pollution because rivers connect plastics production and use upstream to coasts and the open ocean. This project will analyze soil samples to quantify the amount and types microplastics found in different floodplain environments, and relate patterns of plastic accumulation to environmental parameters.

To slow climate change we need to stop burning fossil fuels and to find ways to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. When kelp and other macroalgae grow, they store carbon in their biomass, but they also continuously release organic carbon into ocean waters. The current project aims to understand whether this released organic carbon is also stored, not in the seaweeds themselves, but in the deep sea. Understanding what happens to all the carbon seaweeds capture is critical to Running Tide technologies that seek to use macroalgae to remove sufficient carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to help slow or reduce climate change.

HIV-1 integrates its genome into infected host cells. Due to the permanence of the integrated genome, it is advantageous to target HIV-1 replication in early stages, before integration. To rationally design new inhibitors of these early replication steps, a detailed molecular understanding is required. This work proposes integrated biochemical, biophysical, and cellular approaches to probe critical steps in early viral replication.

Moduli Spaces and Geometric Microlocal Analysis
Metrics with singularities are important objects in differential geometry and arise naturally in algebraic geometry, mathematical physics, number theory, representation theory, etc. This project involves studying singular metrics using geometric microlocal analysis. The central idea is to introduce new objects, called compactifications or resolutions, to resolve the singularities. These resolutions will in turn suggest which analytic techniques need to be developed. The PI intends to use this method to study problems such as the moduli space construction of constant curvature conical metrics and its relation to vortices, hyperbolic metrics with cusps and asymptotic geometry of the compactified Riemann moduli space, and gauge-theoretic partial differential equations with singular metric background.

Evaluating environmental control (AVOID) and inhibitory control (RESIST) strategies to improve weight management outcomes.
This prospective, four-parallel-arm, randomized controlled trial tests two theoretically driven strategies to improve weight and dietary outcomes in women and men with overweight or obesity who are attempting to lose weight: an environmental control strategy and an impulse control training strategy. This research addresses the oft-debated question of how to best optimize behavior change, and whether one should attempt to resist temptation in consistently inhibiting impulses or avoid temptation altogether in eliminating unhealthy options from the home environment.

Cooperative
Education
Founded over a century ago, our co-op program is one of the largest and most innovative of its kind in the world. Through cooperative education, students are able to develop professional skills, meet valuable contacts, and explore one or more career paths.
For over 100 years, Northeastern has been a world leader in cooperative education (co-op), the University’s cornerstone experiential learning program.
By alternating semesters of academic study with periods of full-time work, students are able to transform work across academic and professional contexts. Co-op provides students the opportunity to explore or refine potential career paths, make valuable industry connections, broaden perspectives, and acquire the skills and knowledge needed to succeed —all while learning and growing outside the comfort zone of the classroom.
All Northeastern students can participate in the co-op program. Undergraduates must first complete three academic semesters and alternate periods of academic study with six-month periods of work experience in their field(s) of interest. Transfer students are eligible to start co-op after completing at least one academic semester at Northeastern.
Co-op advisors help students plan up to three co-ops while staying on track for graduation in 4-5 years.
The program starts with a mandatory preparation course and required reflections, both during and post co-op, to help reinforce learning. Reflections can be completed as part of an expo, poster presentation, essay, video, or meeting.
Students gain up to 18 months of professional experience and may work in world-renowned health care institutions, neighborhood health clinics, with multinational biotechnology companies, as well as nonprofit research labs. Students develop impressive resumes and many receive offers of employment from their co-op employer.
Most co-ops are full-time, paid positions with the co-op employer. Students do not pay tuition while on co-op, although they are still considered full-time students with no change in benefits. Students who complete the co-op program also receive a notation on their college transcript.
Northeastern works with more than 3,100 employers across the United States and in 136 countries around the world.

About Jonathan Blazek
Prof. Jonathan Blazek works in observational and theoretical cosmology. His primary focus is on understanding the Universe using astronomical surveys that cover large areas of the sky. He works on the analytic modeling and numerical methods necessary to connect these observations to the underlying cosmological model. Of particular focus in his research are applications of galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing to map out structure in the Universe.
Prof. Blazek is a member of the Dark Energy Survey and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Dark Energy Science Collaboration. He is also involved with efforts to combine data sets from multiple different experiments that observe at different wavelengths and use different techniques. This “combined-probe” approach will produce the most informative tests of our cosmological model. Prior to joining Northeastern, Prof. Blazek was a postdoctoral fellow at EPFL in Switzerland and at Ohio State University. He received his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley.
We aim to unravel the mysteries of the Universe, including the nature of dark energy and dark matter, the laws of gravity on the largest scales, and the earliest moments after the Big Bang. To study these topics, we model and analyze observations of galaxies and other astrophysical objects, especially from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera Rubin Observatory.

When hurricanes roar in, expect sharks to head out to sea, corals to shatter, and grouper and other reef fish to end up dead on shorelines.
Hurricane Milton was making its way across the Gulf of Mexico Wednesday and expected to make landfall in the Tampa Bay area on the west coast of Florida.
A big storm like Milton can be expected to churn the water 60 to 80 feet below the sea’s surface, says Mark Patterson, a professor at Northeastern’s Marine Science Center.

The 52,000-year-old freeze-dried remains of a woolly mammoth were so remarkably preserved that scientists were recently able to reconstruct its genome. Their discovery not only unearths new information about these ancient creatures but reveals a new kind of natural preservation that could open the door to studying other intact ancient animals.
“This is fascinating because this is a new type of fossil,” says Michele Di Pierro, an assistant professor of physics at Northeastern University who was one of many researchers involved in the research that was published in Cell. “Typically, we see in fossils the displacement of organic material with minerals, and that preserves larger structures. Here, this is a molecular fossil. Here we’re talking about each piece of DNA … is in exactly the same position as it was 50,000 years ago.”

About Mark Patterson
I direct the Field Robotics Laboratory (FRL). We design and build free-swimming marine robots, and new kinds of sensors and systems for ecophysiology. I have always loved marine ecology and biomechanics, because they are so interdisciplinary. Inspired by Ken Sebens and the late Steven Vogel and Tom McMahon, I like asking questions that require new technology to find the answer. Serious students of the history of science know that this is usually how science advances: new instruments lead to new insights that often spawn whole disciplines, rather than vice versa.
For the last two decades, our lab has been developing Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), free-swimming robots that survey the bottom and water column in ways superior to previous approaches like towed bodies or lowering an instrument over the side of a ship. We use AUVs to make new discoveries such as coherent structures of lowered oxygen over coral reefs, how krill swarms in the Antarctic appear on high frequency side scan sonar, and how to identify fishes from their side scan sonar images using neural network processing. This last area is poised to become a new tool for fisheries stock surveys and one of our vehicles is in use for this purpose by NOAA. Our team is convinced that AUVs are oceanography’s most important recent technological advance.
Our lab holds patents in the area of marine robotics (US 5,995,882) and using machine learning to interpret underwater imagery (US 7,221,621). The original Fetch AUV currently holds the record for the longest continuously operating underwater vehicle. Currently, we are working on 1) designing a deep-sea autonomous vehicle swarm that can persist on-station for months, and return thousands of miles back to shore with physical samples, using a radical new approach to AUV design, 2) exploring how biologically-inspired autonomy (from organisms as diverse as salps, squids, sponges, fishes, and marine mammals and reptiles) can increase the robust intelligence and extended deployment performance of AUVs, 3) integrating new sensors for the detection of microplastics into AUVs in collaboration with Ocean Diagnostics, a blue-tech startup in Canada, and 4) developing methods to thwart the misuse of unmanned underwater systems by terrorists in ports and harbors.
The physical biology of invertebrates (sponges, cnidarians, squid), plants (macroalgae, sunflowers, seagrasses), and fishes is another area that our lab investigates. The allometry of metabolism is an area where we apply chemical engineering theory to aquatic invertebrates and algae. Contrary to the predictions of “universal scaling laws” that have appeared in the literature, these taxa do not follow 3/4 power scaling of metabolic rate with body mass. Instead they exhibit a diversity of scaling exponents for which we have developed a predictive theory based on first principles from fluid transport and mass transfer, as well as the effect of living in groups.
This “flow modulated allometry” model is has been extensively tested in our laboratory, and in the field using saturation diving underwater laboratories. Since 1984, we have used saturation underwater habitats to conduct research in situ on corals and their allies. Using these unique inner space stations, that provide the gift of time to conduct elaborate experiments, we have examined how reef corals respond to water motion during bleaching episodes by altering their photobiology and expression of stress proteins. Our lab has recently developed a predictive electrical network model of the gastrovascular system of corals of the two types of coral bauplan, perforate (where an extensive plumbing connects the polyps) and imperforate (where polyps are not connected directly). This model will help us understand how corals respond to environmental stress including that posed by global warming and ocean acidification. We have also used network science to investigate the resilience and robustness of the coral-symbiont associations on a local, regional, and global scale as a means to understand vulnerability of these paradoxically fragile yet robust ecosystems.
Prof. Patterson is a joint appointment between the College of Science and the College of Engineering.
The MSC’s research topics relate to understanding how the projected impacts of climate change will affect marine habitants, and how urban communities along the coast can best prepare for these impacts.
The Patterson lab works to develop autonomous underwater robots for civil infrastructure and marine sensing and decision support tools for gray/green infrastructure like tide gates while studying environmental fluid mechanics,biomechanics, and mass transfer in living systems.

As Hurricane Milton barrels toward central Florida, Northeastern University disaster recovery experts say residents should expect extensive destruction from the storm and its surge — particularly if Tampa is hit directly.
“Tampa is the most vulnerable place,” says Q. Jim Chen, professor of civil and environmental engineering and marine and environmental sciences at Northeastern.

Warnings about Hurricane Milton hitting Florida have dominated news reports this week. But there have been warnings from forecasters with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center about another storm brewing: a severe geomagnetic storm.
What is a geomagnetic storm?
According to Jonathan Blazek, an assistant professor of physics at Northeastern University, these events are triggered by a coronal mass ejection, which is when the sun lets off a mass ejection of particles. Sometimes, these particles hit Earth and interact with our magnetic field and upper layers of the atmosphere. This, Blazek says, is a geomagnetic storm.
