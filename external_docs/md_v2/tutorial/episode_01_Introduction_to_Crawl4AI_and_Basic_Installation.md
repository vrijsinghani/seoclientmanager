# Crawl4AI

## Episode 1: Introduction to Crawl4AI and Basic Installation

### Quick Intro
Walk through installation from PyPI, setup, and verification. Show how to install with options like `torch` or `transformer` for advanced capabilities.

Here's a condensed outline of the **Installation and Setup** video content:

---

1) **Introduction to Crawl4AI**: Briefly explain that Crawl4AI is a powerful tool for web scraping, data extraction, and content processing, with customizable options for various needs.

2) **Installation Overview**:   
   
   - **Basic Install**: Run `pip install crawl4ai` and `playwright install` (to set up browser dependencies).
 
   - **Optional Advanced Installs**:
     - `pip install crawl4ai[torch]` - Adds PyTorch for clustering.
     - `pip install crawl4ai[transformer]` - Adds support for LLM-based extraction.
     - `pip install crawl4ai[all]` - Installs all features for complete functionality.

3) **Verifying the Installation**:
   
   - Walk through a simple test script to confirm the setup:
      ```python
      import asyncio
      from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
      
      async def main():
          async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:
              result = await crawler.arun(url="https://www.example.com")
              print(result.markdown[:500])  # Show first 500 characters

      asyncio.run(main())
      ```
   - Explain that this script initializes the crawler and runs it on a test URL, displaying part of the extracted content to verify functionality.

4) **Important Tips**:
   
   - **Run** `playwright install` **after installation** to set up dependencies.
   - **For full performance** on text-related tasks, run `crawl4ai-download-models` after installing with `[torch]`, `[transformer]`, or `[all]` options.
   - If you encounter issues, refer to the documentation or GitHub issues.

5) **Wrap Up**:
   
   - Introduce the next topic in the series, which will cover Crawl4AI's browser configuration options (like choosing between `chromium`, `firefox`, and `webkit`).
