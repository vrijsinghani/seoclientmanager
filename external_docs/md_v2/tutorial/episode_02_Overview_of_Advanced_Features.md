### **Overview of Advanced Features**

1) **Introduction to Advanced Features**:
 
   - Briefly introduce Crawl4AIâ€™s advanced tools, which let users go beyond basic crawling to customize and fine-tune their scraping workflows.

2) **Taking Screenshots**:
 
   - Explain the screenshot capability for capturing page state and verifying content.
   - **Example**:
      ```python
      result = await crawler.arun(url="https://www.example.com", screenshot=True)
      ```
   - Mention that screenshots are saved as a base64 string in `result`, allowing easy decoding and saving.

3) **Media and Link Extraction**:
 
   - Demonstrate how to pull all media (images, videos) and links (internal and external) from a page for deeper analysis or content gathering.
   - **Example**:
      ```python
      result = await crawler.arun(url="https://www.example.com")
      print("Media:", result.media)
      print("Links:", result.links)
      ```

4) **Custom User Agent**:
 
   - Show how to set a custom user agent to disguise the crawler or simulate specific devices/browsers.
   - **Example**:
      ```python
      result = await crawler.arun(url="https://www.example.com", user_agent="Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MyCrawler/1.0)")
      ```

5) **Custom Hooks for Enhanced Control**:
 
   - Briefly cover how to use hooks, which allow custom actions like setting headers or handling login during the crawl.
   - **Example**: Setting a custom header with `before_get_url` hook.
      ```python
      async def before_get_url(page):
          await page.set_extra_http_headers({"X-Test-Header": "test"})
      ```

6) **CSS Selectors for Targeted Extraction**:
 
   - Explain the use of CSS selectors to extract specific elements, ideal for structured data like articles or product details.
   - **Example**:
      ```python
      result = await crawler.arun(url="https://www.example.com", css_selector="h2")
      print("H2 Tags:", result.extracted_content)
      ```

7) **Crawling Inside Iframes**:
 
   - Mention how enabling `process_iframes=True` allows extracting content within iframes, useful for sites with embedded content or ads.
   - **Example**:
      ```python
      result = await crawler.arun(url="https://www.example.com", process_iframes=True)
      ```

8) **Wrap-Up**:
 
   - Summarize these advanced features and how they allow users to customize every part of their web scraping experience.
   - Tease upcoming videos where each feature will be explored in detail.
