Accessibility
As recently as January 2020, the World Health Organization estimated that there are more than one billion people living with disabilities, with over 100 million persons having significant difficulties in functioning (for more information, see https://www.who.int/health-topics/disability#tab=tab_1).
Many of these disabilities can affect access to information technologies. Additionally, the same individuals who run into barriers that impede access to information technologies could benefit most from using them.
Given the importance of the internet, accessibility to the web is of critical importance to people with disabilities around the world, including people with auditory, cognitive, physical, neurological, and visual disabilities. It is likewise important to those with accessibility needs due to aging.
Providing accessible web content can also benefit people who do not have disabilities but who are experiencing situational barriers. For example, when accessing the internet from devices with small screens or in low bandwidth situations, or when experiencing barriers due to language or literacy levels, accessibility solutions can also support improved access.
ProPlank Flooring is committed to ensuring equal access for people with disabilities. As potential customers and employees of ProPlank Flooring, they are important contributors to ProPlank Flooring’s business success and should not be excluded, but rather welcomed into the ProPlank Flooring family.
ProPlank Flooring will endeavor to maximize the access of people with disabilities to this website.
If you have any questions, please contact ProPlank Flooring’s Accessibility Coordinator, who can be reached here.

Customer Reviews
ProPlank Flooring Ohio review summary
Paula
If you are looking for any type of flooring, please visit Brandon Cruz at Proplank Flooring in Sheffield Lake. Brandon is one of the nicest guys and honest! He helped us choose the carpet that worked best for our house and check book. His installers did a fantastic job and were in and out before we knew it! I will use them again and highly recommend this company!
Brenda
We had our main floor done in June. We had shopped many stores before we found ProPlank which offered great selection and excellent value. Brandon was very helpful and never tried to rush us even though we struggled with a final decision. Installation went really smooth and Greg and Alex were great. We plan on doing the upstairs in fall and will definitely be back to ProPlank.
Pete
Great job on new step covering. Brandon went the extra mile to help in getting samples to look at before making any decisions. The installation went great by Greg and Alex. Looks fantastic
Tom
The crew at PROPLANK Flooring did a FANTASTIC job!! No pressure from Brandon is the sales room, and the installation was fast ,efficient and AMAZING. THANK YOU PROPLANK for bringing our 1960s home into the 21st century!
Becky
This is the second job Brandon and his crew have completed for us. Excellent craftsmanship and communication. Couldnâ€™t be happier with the results!
I
Great experience with our carpet installation. Brandon and his ProPlank team are very professional and efficient, all while delivering a great installation process, very detailed oriented. If youâ€™re looking for expert carpet installation, I highly recommend ProPlank
Marty
Was a pleasure working with Brandon and his team. They did a fantastic job with our new floors and would highly recommend them!
Katherine
Absolutely excellent customer service, quality and craftsmanship.
Cheryl
Brandon has a wonderful selection of flooring at Proplank and I couldn't be any happier with my vinyl plank flooring choice. In fact, I ended up having it installed in two other areas besides my original plan. Greg and Alec are experts at installing and the entire job was flawless. I would highly reccomend Proplank for any of your flooring needs. Extremely satisfied.
Justin
Had lvp installed in basement and top floor, also some baseboard and shoe molding. Had two sets of stairs and landings carpeted. Everyone was professional, price was competitive and most importantly the work is flawless!
Rachel
We are beyond thrilled with our experience with ProPlank Flooring. Brandon is extremely knowledgeable, personable, and patient. He gave us great and helpful explanations and recommendations about the different products available, and came out to do the measurements himself. We never felt pressured or like we were being "upsold" at all, which we certainly appreciated. We had the flooring replaced in our entire home, with laminate flooring downstairs and carpet upstairs, and the crew who completed the work were clearly very experienced, meticulous, and passionate about not just getting the job done, but getting it done right. Everything looks perfect, and SO much better than the quality of the work done when our house was originally built. We will gladly use Brandon's team and ProPlank flooring for any of our future flooring needs, and wholeheartedly recommend them.
Samuel
Brandon and his team did an absolutely remarkable job. We wanted a floor with no transition pieces as you can see he did a outstanding job his installers are top notch and very knowledgeable. If you want a professional job and a job done right I would highly recommend ProPlank Flooring GREAT JOB BRANDON Sam
Deb
Don't overlook this store if you're looking for quality flooring and service at a great price! We were immediately greeted by Brandon, who is extremely personable and knowledgeable. He reviewed options in carpeting and prices. Within 2 weeks we had new carpeting in the living room and hallway. The installer, Matt was also awesome. He was courteous and detail oriented. Looked so good, we went back a couple of weeks later to add carpeting to the bedroom! We couldn't be more satisfied!
Thomas
Originally, I had planned on installing the floor in my basement renovation project myself. However, time was not on my side. After sitting down with Brandon, I felt comfortable with their reasonable pricing and agreed to let them install the floor and baseboards. When I tell you they exceeded my expectations, that is an understatement. I am over the moon with their work and the pictures speak for themselves! Highly recommend them for any flooring needs! They were very professional, quick, and top of the line in quality.
Mike
I highly recommend ProPlank Flooring! We started out looking at a box store, but found Brandon, and didnâ€™t look back! His products are better quality than the box store, and the pricing is comparable. Brandon is friendly, knowledgeable, patient, and wasnâ€™t pushy at all. If youâ€™re looking for flooring, check with ProPlank Flooring first. Youâ€™ll be happy you did!
