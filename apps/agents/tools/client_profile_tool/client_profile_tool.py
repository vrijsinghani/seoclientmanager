The profile should provide a detailed and accurate overview of the company, its operations, mission, values, target audience, and unique selling propositions (USPs). The information must be factual, objective, and readily usable.

                Specific Instructions:

                Key Information Extraction: Identify and extract crucial details from the website text, including:

                Company Mission and Vision: Summarize the company's mission statement and long-term vision.

                Products/Services: Provide a clear and concise description of the company's offerings, highlighting key features and benefits. Categorize and organize these effectively.

                Target Audience: Describe the company's ideal customer profile(s), including demographics, psychographics, and needs.

                Unique Selling Propositions (USPs): Identify what sets the company apart from competitors and articulates its value proposition to customers.

                Company History (optional): If available, include a brief overview of the company's history and milestones.

                Company Culture and Values (optional): If evident on the website, describe the company's culture and values. This might be inferred from its communication style and messaging.

                Brand Voice and Tone: Analyze the website's overall tone and writing style to determine the appropriate voice for future communications.

                Concise and Structured Output: The profile should be well-organized and easy to read, using clear headings and bullet points where appropriate to improve readability and usability for the subsequent writing agent. Avoid unnecessary details and focus on delivering crucial information efficiently.

                Factual Accuracy: Ensure all information is factual and accurately reflects the content of the provided website data.
