I want to add additional data associated with clients, specifically business_objectives.  business_objectives fields include goal(text), metric(text), target_date(date), date_created(date), date_last_modified(date), status(boolean: active/inactive).

Modify Client Detail page to replace the SEO Data card with a card for business objectives.

the template for displaying business objecitives should leverage the card in templates/pages/projects/timeline, specifically "Timeline with dotted line", for look and feel.
