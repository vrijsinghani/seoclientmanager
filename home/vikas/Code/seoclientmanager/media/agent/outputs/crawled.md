Customer Reviews
ProPlank Flooring Ohio review summary
Paula
If you are looking for any type of flooring, please visit Brandon Cruz at Proplank Flooring in Sheffield Lake. Brandon is one of the nicest guys and honest! He helped us choose the carpet that worked best for our house and check book. His installers did a fantastic job and were in and out before we knew it! I will use them again and highly recommend this company!
Brenda
We had our main floor done in June. We had shopped many stores before we found ProPlank which offered great selection and excellent value. Brandon was very helpful and never tried to rush us even though we struggled with a final decision. Installation went really smooth and Greg and Alex were great. We plan on doing the upstairs in fall and will definitely be back to ProPlank.
Pete
Great job on new step covering. Brandon went the extra mile to help in getting samples
